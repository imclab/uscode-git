  (a) In general
     Before entering into agreements with foreign countries under subchapters II and III–A of this chapter for the provision of commodities, the Secretary or the Administrator, as appropriate, shall consider the extent to which the recipient country is undertaking measures for economic development purposes in order to improve food security and agricultural development, alleviate poverty, and promote broad-based, equitable, and sustainable development.

     An agreement entered into under this chapter shall–
    (1) include an estimate of the annual value or volume of agricultural commodities proposed to be made available to the country or eligible organization under the agreement;
    (2) with respect to agreements entered into with foreign countries under subchapters II and III–A of this chapter, include a statement of the manner in which the agricultural commodities provided under the agreement or the revenues generated by the sale of such commodities (if such commodities are sold), will be integrated into the overall development plans of the country to improve food security and agricultural development, alleviate poverty, and promote broad-based, equitable, and sustainable agriculture and broad-based economic growth;
    (3) with respect to agreements entered into under subchapters II and III–A of this chapter, include a statement of the manner in which competitive private sector participation within the recipient country in the storage, marketing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural commodities made available under this chapter will be encouraged;

    (2) Exception
       The Secretary or the Administrator, as appropriate, may determine not to make assistance available on a multi-year basis with respect to a recipient country or an eligible organization if it is determined that assistance should be provided to such country or through such organization only on an annual basis because–

    (1) making significant economic development reforms;
    (2) promoting free and open markets for food and agricultural producers; and
