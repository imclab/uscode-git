   If, pursuant to this chapter, any compact entered into among three or more of the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Florida, and Connecticut, becomes effective, or if any association or associations are formed, the membership of which includes at least two-thirds of the producers of cigar-filler tobacco and cigar-binder tobacco in three or more of said States, commerce in cigar-filler tobacco produced in Puerto Rico shall be regulated during the period in which any such compact remains effective or such associations continue to operate, as follows:
  (a) Determination of world consumption; ””crop year““ defined
     The Secretary shall determine for each crop year, by calculations from available statistics of the United States Department of Agriculture, the quantity of cigar-filler tobacco produced in the continental United States and Puerto Rico which is likely to be consumed in all countries of the world during such crop year, increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amount by which the world stocks of cigar-filler tobacco (produced in the continental United States and Puerto Rico) at the beginning of such crop year are less than or greater than the normal stocks of such cigar-filler tobacco, as determined by the Secretary. For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall specify as a ””crop year““ such period of twelve months as he deems will facilitate the administration of this section.
  (b) Determination of marketing quota for Puerto Rico
     The Secretary shall determine a marketing quota for Puerto Rico for cigar-filler tobacco for each crop year in which the provisions of this section are operative. Such quota shall be that quantity of cigar-filler tobacco which bears the same proportion (subject to such adjustment, which may be cumulative from one crop year to another, not exceeding 5 per centum of said proportion in any one year, as the Secretary determines is necessary to correct for any abnormal conditions of production during any three normal crop years during the last ten years for trends in production during such crop years and for trends in consumption since such crop years) to the total quantity of cigar-filler tobacco produced in the continental United States and Puerto Rico and required for world consumption (as determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this section) as the average production of cigar-filler tobacco in Puerto Rico in such crop years bore to the average of the total production of cigar-filler tobacco in the continental United States and Puerto Rico in such crop years.
  (c) Establishment of marketing quota for each Puerto Rican farm
     The Secretary shall establish for each farm in Puerto Rico for each crop year a tobacco-marketing quota, giving due consideration to the quantity of cigar-filler tobacco marketed from the crops produced on such farm and by the operator thereof in past years; to the land, labor, and equipment available for production of tobacco on such farm; to the crop-rotation practices on such farm; and to the soil and other physical factors affecting production of tobacco on such farm: T3ProvidedK, That the total of the marketing quotas established for all farms in Puerto Rico for any crop year shall not exceed the marketing quota for Puerto Rico for such crop year.
  (d) Uniform adjustment of marketing quotas
     The marketing quota established for Puerto Rico and the marketing quotas established for farms in Puerto Rico for any crop year pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be subject to such uniform adjustment during the crop year, not exceeding 10 per centum of said quotas, as the Secretary shall determine to be necessary to establish and maintain normal world stocks of cigar-filler tobacco produced in the continental United States and Puerto Rico and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
  (e) Issuance of marketing certificates
     The Secretary shall, under such terms and conditions and in accordance with such methods as may be established in regulations prescribed by him, issue, to buyers or handlers of tobacco from any farm in Puerto Rico, marketing certificates for an amount of tobacco equal to the marketing quota established for such farm, and, for any tobacco marketed in excess of such quota for such farm, sell, to the buyer or handlers of such excess tobacco, marketing certificates for a charge equal to one-third of the current market value of such tobacco, and the Secretary may require the buyer or handler of such excess tobacco to deduct the charge for marketing certificates from the price or proceeds of or advances on such tobacco.
  (f) Payments for production deficits due to adverse conditions
     From the proceeds received from the sale of marketing certificates pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall make payments to the producers of tobacco on farms in Puerto Rico from which the sales of tobacco, because of weather or diseases or loss by fire affecting the tobacco crops thereon adversely during any crop year, are less than the marketing quotas for such farms for such crop year. Such payments shall be at a rate per pound of such deficit as shall be determined by dividing the funds remaining after deduction of such amount as the Secretary estimates to be necessary for the payment of administrative expenses incurred in administering the provisions of this section by the total number of pounds by which the sales of tobacco from all such farms fall below the marketing quotas for such farms.
  (g) Prohibition of sale, etc., without certificate
     The sale, marketing, purchase, or transportation of any cigar-filler tobacco produced, sold, or marketed in Puerto Rico during any period of time when this section shall be in effect is prohibited unless a marketing certificate has been issued for such tobacco by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section.
