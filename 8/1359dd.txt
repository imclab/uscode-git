  (a) Allocation to processors
     Whenever marketing allotments are established for a crop year under section 1359cc of this title, in order to afford all interested persons an equitable opportunity to market sugar under an allotment, the Secretary shall allocate each such allotment among the processors covered by the allotment.
  (b) Hearing and notice
    (1) Cane sugar
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall make allocations for cane sugar after a hearing, if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers, and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of the allocations under this paragraph. Each such allocation shall be subject to adjustment under section 1359cc(g) of this title.
      (B) Multiple processor States
         Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), the Secretary shall allocate the allotment for cane sugar among multiple cane sugar processors in a single State based on–
        (i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from among the 1996 through 2000 crops;
        (ii) the ability of processors to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated for the crop year; and
        (iii) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the average of the 3 highest years of production during the 1996 through 2000 crop years.
      (C) Talisman processing facility
         In the case of allotments under subparagraph (B) attributable to the operations of the Talisman processing facility before May 13, 2002, the Secretary shall allocate the allotment among processors in the State under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the agreements of March 25 and 26, 1999, between the affected processors and the Secretary of the Interior.
      (D) Proportionate share States
         In the case of States subject to section 1359ff(c) of this title, the Secretary shall allocate the allotment for cane sugar among multiple cane sugar processors in a single State based on–
        (i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from among the 1997 through 2001 crop years;
        (ii) the ability of processors to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotments allocated for the crop year; and
        (iii) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the average of the 2 highest crop years of crop production during the 1997 through 2001 crop years.
      (E) New entrants
        (i) In general
           Notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (D), the Secretary, on application of any processor that begins processing sugarcane on or after May 13, 2002, and after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, may provide the processor with an allocation that provides a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of the allocations from the allotment for the State in which the processor is located.
        (ii) Proportionate share States
           In the case of proportionate share States, the Secretary shall establish proportionate shares in a quantity sufficient to produce the sugarcane required to satisfy the allocations.
        (iii) Limitations
           The allotment for a new processor under this subparagraph shall not exceed–
          (I) in the case of the first crop year of operation of a new processor, 50,000 short tons (raw value); and
          (II) in the case of each subsequent crop year of operation of the new processor, a quantity established by the Secretary in accordance with this subparagraph and the criteria described in subparagraph (B) or (D), as applicable.
        (iv) New entrant States
          (I) In general
             Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 1359cc(e)(3) of this title, to accommodate an allocation under clause (i) to a new processor located in a new entrant mainland State, the Secretary shall provide the new entrant mainland State with an allotment.
          (II) Effect on other allotments
             The allotment to any new entrant mainland State shall be subtracted, on a pro rata basis, from the allotments otherwise allotted to each mainland State under section 1359cc(e)(3) of this title.
        (v) Adverse effects
           Before providing an initial processor allocation or State allotment to a new entrant processor or a new entrant State under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration any adverse effects that the provision of the allocation or allotment may have on existing cane processors and producers in mainland States.
        (vi) Ability to market
           Consistent with section 1359cc of this title and this section, any processor allocation or State allotment made to a new entrant processor or to a new entrant State under this subparagraph shall be provided only after the applicant processor, or the applicable processors in the State, have demonstrated the ability to process, produce, and market (including the transfer or delivery of the raw cane sugar to a refinery for further processing or marketing) raw cane sugar for the crop year for which the allotment is applicable.
        (vii) Prohibition
           Not more than 1 processor allocation provided under this subparagraph may be applicable to any individual sugar processing facility.
      (F) Transfer of ownership
         Except as otherwise provided in section 1359ff(c)(8) of this title, if a sugarcane processor is sold or otherwise transferred to another owner or is closed as part of an affiliated corporate group processing consolidation, the Secretary shall transfer the allotment allocation for the processor to the purchaser, new owner, successor in interest, or any remaining processor of an affiliated entity, as applicable, of the processor.
    (2) Beet sugar
      (A) In general
         Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and sections 1359cc(g), 1359ee(b), and 1359ff(b) of this title, the Secretary shall make allocations for beet sugar among beet sugar processors for each crop year that allotments are in effect on the basis of the adjusted weighted average quantity of beet sugar produced by the processors for each of the 1998 through 2000 crop years, as determined under this paragraph.
      (B) Quantity
         The quantity of an allocation made for a beet sugar processor for a crop year under subparagraph (A) shall bear the same ratio to the quantity of allocations made for all beet sugar processors for the crop year as the adjusted weighted average quantity of beet sugar produced by the processor (as determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D)) bears to the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors (as so determined).
      (C) Weighted average quantity
         Subject to subparagraph (D), the weighted quantity of beet sugar produced by a beet sugar processor during each of the 1998 through 2000 crop years shall be (as determined by the Secretary)–
        (i) in the case of the 1998 crop year, 25 percent of the quantity of beet sugar produced by the processor during the crop year;
        (ii) in the case of the 1999 crop year, 35 percent of the quantity of beet sugar produced by the processor during the crop year; and
        (iii) in the case of the 2000 crop year, 40 percent of the quantity of beet sugar produced by the processor (including any quantity of sugar received from the Commodity Credit Corporation) during the crop year.
      (D) Adjustments
        (i) In general
           The Secretary shall adjust the weighted average quantity of beet sugar produced by a beet sugar processor during the 1998 through 2000 crop years under subparagraph (C) if the Secretary determines that the processor–
          (I) during the 1996 through 2000 crop years, opened a sugar beet processing factory;
          (II) during the 1998 through 2000 crop years, closed a sugar beet processing factory;
          (III) during the 1998 through 2000 crop years, constructed a molasses desugarization facility; or
          (IV) during the 1998 through 2000 crop years, suffered substantial quality losses on sugar beets stored during any such crop year.
        (ii) Quantity
           The quantity of beet sugar produced by a beet sugar processor under subparagraph (C) shall be–
          (I) in the case of a processor that opened a sugar beet processing factory, increased by 1.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph) for each sugar beet processing factory that is opened by the processor;
          (II) in the case of a processor that closed a sugar beet processing factory, decreased by 1.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph) for each sugar beet processing factory that is closed by the processor;
          (III) in the case of a processor that constructed a molasses desugarization facility, increased by 0.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph) for each molasses desugarization facility that is constructed by the processor; and
          (IV) in the case of a processor that suffered substantial quality losses on stored sugar beets, increased by 1.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph).
      (E) Permanent termination of operations of a processor
         If a processor of beet sugar has been dissolved, liquidated in a bankruptcy proceeding, or otherwise has permanently terminated operations (other than in conjunction with a sale or other disposition of the processor or the assets of the processor), the Secretary shall–
        (i) eliminate the allocation of the processor provided under this section; and
        (ii) distribute the allocation to other beet sugar processors on a pro rata basis.
      (F) Sale of all assets of a processor to another processor
         If a processor of beet sugar (or all of the assets of the processor) is sold to another processor of beet sugar, the Secretary shall transfer the allocation of the seller to the buyer unless the allocation has been distributed to other sugar beet processors under subparagraph (E).
      (G) Sale of factories of a processor to another processor
        (i) In general
           Subject to subparagraphs (E) and (F), if 1 or more factories of a processor of beet sugar (but not all of the assets of the processor) are sold to another processor of beet sugar during a crop year, the Secretary shall assign a pro rata portion of the allocation of the seller to the allocation of the buyer to reflect the historical contribution of the production of the sold factory or factories to the total allocation of the seller.
        (ii) Application of allocation
           The assignment of the allocation under clause (i) shall apply–
          (I) during the remainder of the crop year during which the sale described in clause (i) occurs (referred to in this subparagraph as the ””initial crop year““); and
          (II) each subsequent crop year (referred in this subparagraph as a ””subsequent crop year““), subject to clause (iii).
        (iii) Subsequent crop years
          (I) In general
             The assignment of the allocation under clause (i) shall apply during each subsequent crop year unless the acquired factory or factories continue in operation for less than the initial crop year and the first subsequent crop year.
          (II) Reassignment
             If the acquired factory or factories do not continue in operation for the complete initial crop year and the first subsequent crop year, the Secretary shall reassign the temporary allocation to other processors of beet sugar on a pro rata basis.
        (iv) Use of other factories to fill allocation
           If the transferred allocation to the buyer for the purchased factory or factories cannot be filled by the production of the purchased factory or factories for the initial crop year or a subsequent crop year, the remainder of the transferred allocation may be filled by beet sugar produced by the buyer from other factories of the buyer.
      (H) New entrants starting production or reopening factories
        (i) In general
           Except as provided by clause (ii), if an individual or entity that does not have an allocation of beet sugar under this subpart (referred to in this paragraph as a ””new entrant““) starts processing sugar beets after May 13, 2002, or acquires and reopens a factory that produced beet sugar during previous crop years that (at the time of acquisition) has no allocation associated with the factory under this subpart, the Secretary shall–
          (I) assign an allocation for beet sugar to the new entrant that provides a fair and equitable distribution of the allocations for beet sugar; and
          (II) reduce the allocations for beet sugar of all other processors on a pro rata basis to reflect the new allocation.
        (ii) Exception
           If a new entrant acquires and reopens a factory that previously produced beet sugar from sugar beets and from sugar beet molasses but the factory last processed sugar beets during the 1997 crop year and the new entrant starts to process sugar beets at such factory after May 13, 2002, the Secretary shall–
          (I) assign an allocation for beet sugar to the new entrant that is not less than the greater of 1.67 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years as determined under subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section, or 1,500,000 hundredweights; and
          (II) reduce the allocations for beet sugar of all other processors on a pro rata basis to reflect the new allocation.
            (I) New entrants acquiring ongoing factories with production history
               If a new entrant acquires a factory that has production history during the period of the 1998 through 2000 crop years and that is producing beet sugar at the time the allocations are made from a processor that has an allocation of beet sugar, the Secretary shall transfer a portion of the allocation of the seller to the new entrant to reflect the historical contribution of the production of the sold factory to the total allocation of the seller.
