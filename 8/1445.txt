   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of section 1441 of this title: (a) For the 1960 crop of any kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas are not disapproved by producers, the support level in cents per pound shall be the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco was supported, or if marketing quotas were disapproved for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco would have been supported if marketing quotas had been in effect. (b) For the 1961 crop and each subsequent crop of any kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas are not disapproved by producers, the support level in cents per pound shall be determined by adjusting the support level for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, or if marketing quotas were disapproved for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco would have been supported if marketing quotas had been in effect, by multiplying such support level for the 1959 crop by the ratio of (i) the average of the index of prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes, as defined in section 1301(a)(1)(C) of this title, for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the marketing year begins for the crop for which the support level is being determined to (ii) the average index of such prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes for the calendar year 1959.
  (c) If acreage poundage or poundage farm marketing quotas are in effect under section 1314c or 1314e of this title, (1) price support shall not be made available on tobacco marketed in excess of 103 per centum of the marketing quota (after adjustments) for the farm on which such tobacco was produced, and (2) for the purpose of price-support eligibility, tobacco carried over from one marketing year to another shall, when marketed, be considered tobacco of the then current crop.
  (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1423 of this title, if the Secretary determines that the supply of any grade of any kind of tobacco of a crop for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers will likely be excessive, the Secretary, after prior consultation with the association through which price support for the grade and kind of tobacco is made available to producers, may reduce the support rate which would otherwise be established for such grade of tobacco after taking into consideration the effect such reduction may have on the supply and price of other grades of other kinds of quota tobacco: T3ProvidedK, That the weighted average of the support rates for all eligible grades of such kind of tobacco shall, after such reduction, reflect not less than (1) 65 per centum of the increase in the support level for such kind of tobacco which would otherwise be established under this section, if the support level therefor is higher then the support level for the preceding crop, or (2) the support level for such kind of tobacco established under this section, if the support level therefor is not higher than the support level for the preceding crop. In determining whether the supply of any grade of any kind of tobacco of a crop will be excessive, the Secretary shall take into consideration the domestic supply, including domestic inventories, the amount of such tobacco pledged as security for price support loans, and anticipated domestic and export demand, based on the maturity, uniformity and stalk position of such tobacco.
  (e) Omitted
  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section–
    (1) For the 1984 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported.
    (2) For the 1985 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, the amount by which (A) the support level for the 1985 crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section, is greater or less than (B) the support level for the 1984 crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section, as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section if the support level under clause (A) is greater than the support level under clause (B), except that the support level for the 1985 crop shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported if the support level as determined under subsection (b) of this section for the 1985 crop would not be more than 5 per centum greater than the support level as determined under subsection (b) of this section for the 1984 crop.
    (3) For the 1984 crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers and for the 1985 crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the Secretary shall establish the support level at such level as will not narrow the normal price support differential between Flue-cured tobacco and such other kind of tobacco. Before establishing the support level under this paragraph for any such kind of tobacco the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the level the Secretary proposes to establish and give an opportunity for the public to comment on the proposal. In determining the level to be established under this paragraph for a particular kind of tobacco, the Secretary shall take into consideration the cost of producing such kind of tobacco, the supply and demand conditions for such kind of tobacco, the comments received in response to the public notice of the proposal, and such other relevant factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.
    (4) For the 1985 and 1986 crops of Burley tobacco, the support level shall be $1.488 per pound.
    (5) For the 1986 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be $1.438 per pound.
    (6)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), for the 1986 and each subsequent crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the immediately preceding crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, the amount by which–
        (i) the support level for the crop for which the determination is being made, as determined under subsection (b) of this section; is greater or less than
        (ii) the support level for the immediately preceding crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section,
       as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section if the support level under clause (i) is greater than the support level under clause (ii).
      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and subsection (d) of this section, if requested by the board of directors of an association through which price support for the respective kind of tobacco specified in subparagraph (A) is made available to producers, the Secretary may reduce the support level for such kind of tobacco to the extent requested by the association to more accurately reflect the market value and improve the marketability of such tobacco.
    (7)      (A) For the 1987 and each subsequent crop of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the immediately preceding crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, an adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of–
        (i) 66.7 percent of the amount by which–
          (I) the average price received by producers for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco, respectively, on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, is greater or less than
          (II) the average price received by producers for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco, respectively, on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and
        (ii) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by tobacco producers from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)–
        (i) the average market price for Burley tobacco for the 1985 marketing year shall be reduced by $0.039 per pound;
        (ii) the average market price for Burley tobacco for the 1984 and each prior applicable marketing year shall be reduced by $0.30 per pound;

  (g)    (1) Effective only for each of the 1994 through 1998 crops of tobacco for which price support is made available under this Act, each producer and purchaser of such tobacco, and each importer of the same kind of tobacco, shall remit to the Commodity Credit Corporation a nonrefundable marketing assessment in an amount equal to–
      (A) in the case of a producer or purchaser of domestic tobacco, .5 percent of the national price support level for each such crop; and
      (B) in the case of an importer of tobacco, 1 percent of the national support price for the same kind of tobacco;
         as provided for in this section.
    (2) Such producer, purchaser, and importer assessments shall be–
      (A) collected in the same manner as provided for in section 1445–1(d)(2) or 1445–2(d)(3) of this title, as applicable; and
      (B) enforced in the same manner as provided in section 1445–1(h) or 1445–2(j) of this title, as applicable.
