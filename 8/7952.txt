  (a) Average yield and acreage average for historic peanut producers
    (1) Determination of average yield
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant or was prevented from planting peanuts.
      (B) Assigned yields
         For the purposes of determining the 4-year average yield for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the historic peanut producer may elect to substitute for a farm, for not more than 3 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years in which the producer planted peanuts on the farm, the average yield for peanuts produced in the county in which the farm is located for the 1990 through 1997 crop years.
    (2) Determination of acreage average
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the 4-year average of the following:
        (i) Acreage planted to peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years.
        (ii) Any acreage on each farm that the historic peanut producer was prevented from planting to peanuts during the 1998 through 2001 crop years because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the historic peanut producer, as determined by the Secretary.
      (B) Inclusion of all 4 years in average
         For the purposes of determining the 4-year acreage average for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which the producer did not plant peanuts.
      (C) Proportional shares
         If more than 1 historic peanut producer shared in the risk of producing the crop on a farm, the historic peanut producers shall receive their proportional share of the number of acres planted (or prevented from being planted) to peanuts for harvest on the farm based on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for the crop.
    (3) Time for determinations
       The Secretary shall make the determinations required by this subsection as soon as practicable after May 13, 2002.
    (4) Special considerations
       In making the determinations required by this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account changes in the number, identity, or interest of producers sharing in the risk of producing a peanut crop since the 1998 crop year, including providing a method for the assignment of average acres and average yield to a farm–
      (A) when an historic peanut producer is no longer living;
      (B) when an entity composed of historic peanut producers has been dissolved; or
      (C) in other appropriate situations, as determined by the Secretary.
  (b) Assignment of average yields and average acreage to farms
    (1) Assignment by historic peanut producers
       The Secretary shall give each historic peanut producer an opportunity to assign the average peanut yield and average acreage determined under subsection (a) of this section for each farm of the historic peanut producer to cropland on that farm or another farm in the same State or a contiguous State.
    (2) Limitation on acreage assignment
       Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the average acreage determined under subsection (a)(2) of this section for a farm may not be assigned to a farm in a contiguous State unless–
      (A) the historic peanut producer making the assignment produced peanuts in that State during at least 1 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years; or
      (B) as of March 31, 2003, the historic peanut producer is a producer on a farm in that State.
    (3) Notice of assignment opportunity
       The Secretary shall provide notice to historic peanut producers regarding their opportunity to assign average peanut yields and average acreages to farms under paragraph (1). The notice shall include the following:
      (A) Notice that the opportunity to make the assignments is being provided only once.
      (B) A description of the limitation in paragraph (2) on their ability to make the assignments.
      (C) Information regarding the manner in which the assignments must be made and the time periods and manner in which notice of the assignments must be submitted to the Secretary.
    (4) Assignment deadlines
       Not later than March 31, 2003, an historic peanut producer shall submit to the Secretary notice of the assignments made by the producer under this subsection. If an historic peanut producer fails to submit the notice by that date, the notice shall be submitted in such other manner as the Secretary may prescribe.
  (c) Payment yield
     The average of all of the yields assigned by historic peanut producers under subsection (b) of this section to a farm shall be considered to be the payment yield for that farm for the purpose of making direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subchapter.
  (d) Base acres for peanuts
     Subject to subsection (e) of this section, the total number of acres assigned by historic peanut producers under subsection (b) of this section to a farm shall be considered to be the farm“s base acres for peanuts for the purpose of making direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subchapter.
  (e) Treatment of conservation reserve contract acreage
    (1) In general
       The Secretary shall provide for an adjustment, as appropriate, in the base acres for peanuts for a farm whenever either of the following circumstances occur:
      (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831) with respect to the farm expires or is voluntarily terminated.
      (B) Cropland is released from coverage under a conservation reserve contract by the Secretary.
    (2) Special payment rules
       For the crop year in which a base acres for peanuts adjustment under paragraph (1) is first made, the owner of the farm shall elect to receive either direct payments and counter-cyclical payments with respect to the acreage added to the farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under the conservation reserve contract, but not both.
  (f) Prevention of excess base acres for peanuts
    (1) Required reduction
       If the sum of the base acres for peanuts for a farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2), exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary shall reduce the base acres for peanuts for the farm or the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities under subchapter I of this chapter for the farm so that the sum of the base acres for peanuts and acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland acreage of the farm.
    (2) Other acreage
       For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include the following:
      (A) Any base acres for the farm under subchapter I of this chapter.
      (B) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the conservation reserve program or wetlands reserve program under chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.).
      (C) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a conservation program for which payments are made in exchange for not producing an agricultural commodity on the acreage.
    (3) Selection of acres
       The Secretary shall give the owner of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for peanuts or the subchapter I base acres against which the reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.
    (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage
       In applying paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the case of double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.
    (5) Coordinated application of requirements
       The Secretary shall take into account section 7911(g) of this title when applying the requirements of this subsection.
  (g) Permanent reduction in base acres for peanuts
     The owner of a farm may reduce, at any time, the base acres for peanuts assigned to the farm. The reduction shall be permanent and made in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.
