  (c) The fees and limitations imposed by the President by proclamation under this section and any revocation, suspension, or modification thereof, shall become effective on such date as shall be therein specified, and such fees shall be treated for administrative purposes and for the purposes of section 612c of this title, as duties imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1202 et seq.], but such fees shall not be considered as duties for the purpose of granting any preferential concession under any international obligation of the United States.
  (d) After investigation, report, finding, and declaration in the manner provided in the case of a proclamation issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, any proclamation or provision of such proclamation may be suspended or terminated by the President whenever he finds and proclaims that the circumstances requiring the proclamation or provision thereof no longer exist or may be modified by the President whenever he finds and proclaims that changed circumstances require such modification to carry out the purposes of this section.
  (e) Any decision of the President as to facts under this section shall be final.
  (f) No quantitative limitation or fee shall be imposed under this section with respect to any article that is the product of a WTO member (as defined in section 3501(10) of title 19).
