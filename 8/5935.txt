  (a) Findings
     Congress finds thatâ€“
    (1) remote sensing data can be useful to predict impending famine problems and forest infestations in time to allow remedial action;
    (2) remote sensing data can inform the agricultural community as to the condition of crops and the land that sustains those crops; and
    (3) remote sensing data and other data can be valuable, when received on a timely basis, in determining the need for additional plantings of a particular crop or a substitute crop.
  (b) Information development
     The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, maximizing private funding and involvement, shall provide farmers and other interested persons with timely information, through remote sensing, on crop conditions, fertilization and irrigation needs, pest infiltration, soil conditions, projected food, feed, and fiber production, and any other information available through remote sensing.
  (c) Coordination
     The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall jointly develop a proposal to provide farmers and other prospective users with supply and demand information for food and fibers.
  (d) Sunset
     The authorities provided by this section shall expire 5 years after April 4, 1996.
