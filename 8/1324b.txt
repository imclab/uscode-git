        (i) United States passport; \1\N
        (ii) resident alien card, alien registration card, or other document designated by the Attorney General, if the document–
          (I) contains a photograph of the individual and such other personal identifying information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes of this subsection,
          (II) is evidence of authorization of employment in the United States, and
          (III) contains security features to make it resistant to tampering, counterfeiting, and fraudulent use.
      (C) Documents evidencing employment authorization
         A document described in this subparagraph is an individual“s–
        (i) social security account number card (other than such a card which specifies on the face that the issuance of the card does not authorize employment in the United States); or
        (ii) other documentation evidencing authorization of employment in the United States which the Attorney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this section.
      (D) Documents establishing identity of individual

        (ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in a State which does not provide for issuance of an identification document (other than a driver“s license) referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal identity of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.
      (E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents
         If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this subsection.
    (2) Individual attestation of employment authorization
       The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on the form designated or established for purposes of paragraph (1), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien who is authorized under this chapter or by the Attorney General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment. Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or an electronic signature.
    (3) Retention of verification form
       After completion of such form in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person or entity must retain a paper, microfiche, microfilm, or electronic version of the form and make it available for inspection by officers of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor during a period beginning on the date of the hiring, recruiting, or referral of the individual and ending–
      (A) in the case of the recruiting or referral for a fee (without hiring) of an individual, three years after the date of the recruiting or referral, and
      (B) in the case of the hiring of an individual–
        (i) three years after the date of such hiring, or

     Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize, directly or indirectly, the issuance or use of national identification cards or the establishment of a national identification card.
  (d) Evaluation and changes in employment verification system
    (1) Presidential monitoring and improvements in system
      (A) Monitoring
         The President shall provide for the monitoring and evaluation of the degree to which the employment verification system established under subsection (b) of this section provides a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States and shall examine the suitability of existing Federal and State identification systems for use for this purpose.
      (B) Improvements to establish secure system
         To the extent that the system established under subsection (b) of this section is found not to be a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States, the President shall, subject to paragraph (3) and taking into account the results of any demonstration projects conducted under paragraph (4), implement such changes in (including additions to) the requirements of subsection (b) of this section as may be necessary to establish a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States. Such changes in the system may be implemented only if the changes conform to the requirements of paragraph (2).
    (2) Restrictions on changes in system
       Any change the President proposes to implement under paragraph (1) in the verification system must be designed in a manner so the verification system, as so changed, meets the following requirements:
      (A) Reliable determination of identity

        (i) a person with the identity claimed by an employee or prospective employee is eligible to work, and
        (ii) the employee or prospective employee is claiming the identity of another individual.
      (B) Using of counterfeit-resistant documents
         If the system requires that a document be presented to or examined by an employer, the document must be in a form which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.
      (C) Limited use of system
         Any personal information utilized by the system may not be made available to Government agencies, employers, and other persons except to the extent necessary to verify that an individual is not an unauthorized alien.

         The system must protect the privacy and security of personal information and identifiers utilized in the system.
      (E) Limited denial of verification
         A verification that an employee or prospective employee is eligible to be employed in the United States may not be withheld or revoked under the system for any reason other than that the employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized alien.
      (F) Limited use for law enforcement purposes
         The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes, other than for enforcement of this chapter or sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18.
      (G) Restriction on use of new documents
         If the system requires individuals to present a new card or other document (designed specifically for use for this purpose) at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such document may not be required to be presented for any purpose other than under this chapter (or enforcement of sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18) nor to be carried on one“s person.
