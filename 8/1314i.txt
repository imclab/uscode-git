    (3) Limitation
       If the total quantity of Burley tobacco required to be purchased by all manufacturers under paragraph (2) would reduce the inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations for Burley tobacco to less than the reserve stock level for Burley tobacco, the Secretary shall reduce the quantity of tobacco required to be purchased by manufacturers under paragraph (2), on a pro rata basis, to ensure that the inventories will not be less than the reserve stock level for Burley tobacco.
