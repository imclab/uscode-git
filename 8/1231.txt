  (a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed
    (1) Removal period
      (A) In general
         Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the ””removal period““).
      (B) Beginning of period
         The removal period begins on the latest of the following:
        (i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.
        (ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court“s final order.
        (iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.
      (C) Suspension of period
         The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in detention during such extended period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien“s departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien“s removal subject to an order of removal.
    (2) Detention
       During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall the Attorney General release an alien who has been found inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title.
    (3) Supervision after 90-day period
       If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien–
      (A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for identification;
      (B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States Government;

      (A) In general
         Except as provided in section 259(a) of title 42 and paragraph (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.
      (B) Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of sentence of imprisonment
         The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in accordance with applicable procedures under this chapter before the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment–
        (i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense related to smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this title \1\N and (II) the removal of the alien is appropriate and in the best interest of the United States; or
        (ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or a political subdivision of a State), if the chief State official exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of the alien determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III) submits a written request to the Attorney General that such alien be so removed.

      (D) No private right
         No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph against any official of the United States or of any State to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or removal of any alien.
    (5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering
       If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
    (6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens
       An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).
    (7) Employment authorization
       No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific finding that–
      (A) the alien cannot be removed due to the refusal of all countries designated by the alien or under this section to receive the alien, or
      (B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.

        (iv) the Attorney General decides that removing the alien to the country is prejudicial to the United States.
      (D) Alternative country
         If an alien is not removed to a country designated under subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney General shall remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen unless the government of the country–

      (A) In general
         Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien“s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien“s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

        (iv) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the United States.
         For purposes of clause (ii), an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony (or felonies) for which the alien has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.
