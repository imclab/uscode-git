    (3) Suspension
       The court may for good cause suspend the sentence of an alien under this subsection and order the alien“s release under such conditions as the court may prescribe.

      (F) the eligibility of the alien for discretionary relief under the immigration laws.
  (b) Willful failure to comply with terms of release under supervision
     An alien who shall willfully fail to comply with regulations or requirements issued pursuant to section 1231(a)(3) of this title or knowingly give false information in response to an inquiry under such section shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
  (c) Penalties relating to vessels and aircraft
    (1) Civil penalties
      (A) Failure to carry out certain orders

      (B) Failure to remove alien stowaways
         If the Attorney General is satisfied that a person has failed to remove an alien stowaway as required under section 1231(d)(2) of this title, the person shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $5,000 for each alien stowaway not removed.

    (2) Clearing vessels and aircraft
      (A) Clearance before decision on liability
         A vessel or aircraft may be granted clearance before a decision on liability is made under paragraph (1) only if a bond approved by the Attorney General or an amount sufficient to pay the civil penalty is deposited with the Commissioner.
      (B) Prohibition on clearance while penalty unpaid
         A vessel or aircraft may not be granted clearance if a civil penalty imposed under paragraph (1) is not paid.
  (d) Discontinuing granting visas to nationals of country denying or delaying accepting alien
