  (b) Grants authorized
    (1) In general
       The Secretary of Agriculture may make competitive grants, for periods not to exceed 5 years, to eligible entities to conduct research, education, or information dissemination projects for the development and advancement of precision agriculture.
    (2) Private sector financing
       A grant under this section shall be used to support only a project that the Secretary determines is unlikely to be financed by the private sector.
    (3) Consultation with Advisory Board
       The Secretary shall make grants under this section in consultation with the Advisory Board.
  (c) Purposes of projects
     A research, education, or information dissemination project supported by a grant under this section shall address 1 or more of the following purposes:
    (1) The study and promotion of components of precision agriculture technologies using a systems research approach designed to increase long-term site-specific and whole-farm production efficiencies, productivity, and profitability.
    (2) The improvement in the understanding of agronomic or horticultural systems, including, soil, water, land cover (including grazing land), pest management systems, product variability, and meteorological variability.
    (3) The provision of training and educational programs for State cooperative extension services agents, and other professionals involved in the production and transfer of integrated precision agriculture technology.
    (4) The development, demonstration, and dissemination of information regarding precision agriculture technologies and systems and the potential costs and benefits of precision agriculture as it relates to–
      (A) increased long-term farm production efficiencies, productivity, and profitability;
      (B) the maintenance of the environment;
      (C) improvements in international trade; and
      (D) an integrated program of education for agricultural producers and consumers, including family owned and operated farms.
    (5) The promotion of systems research and education projects focusing on the integration of the multiple aspects of precision agriculture, including development, production-scale implementation, and farm production efficiencies, productivity, and profitability.

  (d) Grant priorities
     In making grants to eligible entities under this section, the Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Board, shall give priority to research, education, or information dissemination projects designed to accomplish the following:
