  (a) Sense of Congress
     It is the sense of Congress thatâ€“
    (1) diseases affecting the entire honeybee population impact on the ability of honeybees to carry out crop pollination and honey production, and therefore impact negatively on beekeepers, producers and consumers; and
    (2) certain diseases (such as those caused by tracheal mite, varroa mite, and the Africanized honeybee) pose a threat to the continued well-being of the general honeybee population, and thus merit further study.
  (b) Research
     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Agriculture shall give priority attention to the funding of research regarding the diseases referred to in subsection (a) of this section that are affecting the honeybee population.
