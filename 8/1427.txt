      (A) make available any farm commodity or product thereof owned or controlled by the Corporation for use in relieving distress–
        (i) in any area in the United States (including the Virgin Islands) declared by the President to be an acute distress area because of unemployment or other economic cause, if the President finds that the use will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities; and
        (ii) in connection with any major disaster determined by the President to warrant assistance by the Federal Government under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.); and
