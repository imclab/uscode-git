         Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court“s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.
      (C) Alien“s brief
         The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause shown.

         If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner“s nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.
      (B) Transfer if issue of fact
         If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner“s nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court under section 2201 of title 28.
      (C) Limitation on determination

         If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the United States and the district court finds that–

        (ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the defendant“s nationality is presented, the court shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28.
         The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this subparagraph.
      (C) Consequence of invalidation
         If the district court rules that the removal order is invalid, the court shall dismiss the indictment for violation of section 1253(a) of this title. The United States Government may appeal the dismissal to the court of appeals for the appropriate circuit within 30 days after the date of the dismissal.

    (1) Limitations on relief
       Without regard to the nature of the action or claim and without regard to the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court may–

      (B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, the court may order no remedy or relief other than to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with section 1229a of this title. Any alien who is provided a hearing under section 1229a of this title pursuant to this paragraph may thereafter obtain judicial review of any resulting final order of removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.
    (5) Scope of inquiry
       In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, the court“s inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner. There shall be no review of whether the alien is actually inadmissible or entitled to any relief from removal.
  (f) Limit on injunctive relief
