         Subparagraph (A) shall not prevent the arrest and detention of the alien pursuant to subchapter II of this chapter.
  (b) Conditional release if order denied and review sought
    (1) In general
       If a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an application filed pursuant to section 1533 of this title and the Attorney General seeks review of such denial, the judge shall release the alien from custody subject to the least restrictive condition, or combination of conditions, of release described in section 3142(b) and clauses (i) through (xiv) of section 3142(c)(1)(B) of title 18 that–

    (2) No release for certain aliens
       If the judge finds no such condition or combination of conditions, as described in paragraph (1), the alien shall remain in custody until the completion of any appeal authorized by this subchapter.
