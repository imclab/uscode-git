  (b) Penalty
    (1) Determination of penalty
       A penalty shall be assessed against a borrower that refinances or prepays a loan or loan advance, or any portion of a loan or advance, under this section. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the penalty shall be equal to the lesser of–
      (A) the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the loan being refinanced and the present value of the loan discounted at a rate equal to the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the loan being refinanced or prepaid;
      (B) 100 percent of the amount of interest for 1 year on the outstanding principal balance of the loan or loan advance, or any portion of the loan or advance, being refinanced, multiplied by the ratio that–
        (i) the number of quarterly payment dates between the date of the refinancing or prepayment and the maturity date for the loan advance; bears to
        (ii) the number of quarterly payment dates between the first quarterly payment date that occurs 12 years after the end of the year in which the amount being refinanced was advanced and the maturity date of the loan advance; and
      (C)        (i) the present value of 100 percent of the amount of interest for 1 year on the outstanding principal balance of the loan or loan advance, or any portion of the loan or advance, being refinanced or prepaid; plus
        (ii) for the interval between the date of the refinancing or prepayment and the first quarterly payment date that occurs 12 years after the end of the year in which the amount being refinanced or prepaid was advanced, the present value of the difference between–
          (I) each payment scheduled for the interval on the loan amount being refinanced or prepaid; and
          (II) the payment amounts that would be required during the interval on the amounts being refinanced or prepaid if the interest rate on the loan were equal to the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the loan being refinanced or prepaid.
    (2) Limitation
      (A) In general
         Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the penalty provided by paragraph (1)(A) shall be required for refinancing or prepayment under this section.
      (B) Exception
         In the case of a loan advanced under an agreement that permits the refinancing or prepayment of the loan advance based on the payment of 1 year of interest on the outstanding principal balance of the loan advance, a borrower may, in lieu of the penalty required by paragraph (1)(A), pay a penalty as provided by–
        (i) paragraph (1)(B), if the loan advance has reached the 12-year maturity required under the loan agreement for the refinancing or prepayment; or
        (ii) paragraph (1)(C), if the loan advance has not reached the 12-year maturity required under the loan agreement for the refinancing or prepayment.
    (3) Financing of penalty
      (A) In general

        (i) making a payment in the amount of the required penalty at the time of the refinancing; or
        (ii) increasing the outstanding principal balance of the loan advance guaranteed by the Secretary that is being refinanced under this section by the amount of the penalty.
      (B) Increased principal
         If a borrower meets the penalty requirements of paragraph (1) by increasing the outstanding principal balance of the loan advance that is being refinanced, the borrower shall make a payment at the time of the refinancing equal to 2.5 percent of the amount of the penalty that is added to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.
  (c) Loan terms and conditions after refinancing
    (1) In general
       On the payment of a penalty as provided by subsection (b) of this section, the loan or loan advance, or any portion of the loan or advance, shall be refinanced at the interest rate described in paragraph (2) for a term selected by the borrower pursuant to paragraph (3), except that this paragraph shall not apply if the loan advance, or any portion of the advance, is prepaid by the borrower.
    (2) Interest rate
       The interest rate on a loan refinanced under this section shall be determined to be equal to the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to a term selected by the borrower pursuant to paragraph (3), except that such rate shall not be greater than 7 percent per year, subject to subsection (d) of this section.
    (3) Loan term

       The borrower may not select a term pursuant to paragraph (3) that ends after the maturity date set for the loan before the refinancing of the loan under this section.

    (2) Limitation
       A borrower may not exercise the option under paragraph (1) in the case of a loan or loan advance, or portion thereof, if the total amount of such loans for which such option would be exercised exceeds 50 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loans made to such borrower and guaranteed under section 936 of this title.
    (3) Fee
       A borrower that exercises the maximum rate option under paragraph (1) shall, at the time of exercising such option, pay a fee equal to 1 percent of the outstanding principal balance of such loan or loan advance, or portion thereof, for which such option is exercised. Such fee shall be in addition to the penalties and other payments required under subsection (b) of this section.
