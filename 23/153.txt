   The funds apportioned to any State under paragraph (6) of subsection (b) of section 104 of this title that are attributable to urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more shall be made available for expenditure in such urbanized areas for projects in programs approved under subsection (d) of section 105 of this title in accordance with a fair and equitable formula developed by the State which formula has been approved by the Secretary. Such formula shall provide for fair and equitable treatment of incorporated municipalities of 200,000 or more population. Whenever such a formula has not been developed and approved for a State, the funds apportioned to any State under paragraph (6) of subsection (b) of section 104 of this title which are attributable to urbanized areas having a population of 200,000 or more shall be allocated among such urbanized areas within such State for projects in programs approved under subsection (d) of section 105 of this title in the ratio that the population within each such urbanized area bears to the population of all such urbanized areas, or parts thereof, within such State. In the expenditure of funds allocated under the preceding sentence, fair and equitable treatment shall be accorded incorporated municipalities of 200,000 or more population. Funds allocated to an urbanized area under the provisions of this section may, at the request of the Governor and upon approval of the appropriate local officials of the area and the Secretary, be transferred to the allocation of another such area in the State or to the State for use in any urban area.
