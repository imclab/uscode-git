   Any State that shall use the proceeds of bonds issued by the State, county, city, or other political subdivision of the State for the construction of one or more projects on the Federal-aid primary or Interstate System, or extensions of any of the Federal-aid highway systems in urban areas, or for substitute highway projects approved under section 103(e)(4) of this title, may claim payment of any portion of the sums apportioned to it for expenditure on such system or on highway projects approved under section 103(e)(4) of this title to aid in the retirement of the principal of such bonds the proceeds of which were used for projects on the Federal-aid primary system or extensions of any of the Federal-aid highway systems in urban areas or for substitute highway projects approved under section 103(e)(4) of this title and the retirement of the principal and interest of such bonds the proceeds of which were used for projects on the Interstate System at their maturities, to the extent that the proceeds of such bonds have been actually expended in the construction of one or more of such projects. Such claim for payment may be made only when all of the provisions of this title have been complied with to the same extent and with the same effect as though payment were to be made to the State under section 121 of this title, instead of this section, and the Federal share payable shall not exceed the pro rata basis of payment authorized in section 120 of this title. This section shall not be construed as a commitment or obligation on the part of the United States to provide for the payment of the principal or interest of any such bonds. The payment of interest on such bonds and incidental costs in connection with the sale of such bonds shall not be included in the estimated cost of completing the Interstate System.
