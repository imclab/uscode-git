  (b) Not later than one year after the date of issuance of initial guidelines under section 109(m) of this title each State shall have a program for the Interstate system \1\N in accordance with such guidelines. Each State shall certify on January 1st of each year that it has such a program and the Interstate system \1\ is maintained in accordance with that program. If a State fails to certify as required or if the Secretary determines a State is not adequately maintaining the Interstate system \1\ in accordance with such program then the next apportionment of funds to such State for the Interstate system \1\ shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amount which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title. If, within one year from the date the apportionment for a State is reduced under this subsection, the Secretary determines that such State is maintaining the Interstate system \1\ in accordance with the guidelines the apportionment of such State shall be increased by an amount equal to the reduction.

Upon transfer of such amount, the construction on which such amount is based on open-to-traffic segments of the Interstate System in such State as included in the latest interstate cost estimate shall be ineligible and shall not be included in future interstate cost estimates approved or adjusted under section 104(b)(5)(A).

    (1) T4Upon certification acceptanceK.–If a State certifies to the Secretary that any part of the sums apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5)(B) of this title are in excess of the needs of the State for resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitating Interstate System routes and the State is adequately maintaining the Interstate System and the Secretary accepts such certification, the State may transfer such excess part to its apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(3).
    (2) T4UnconditionalK.–Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State may transfer to its apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(3) of this title–
