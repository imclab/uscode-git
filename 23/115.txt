  (a) T4Substitute, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement, Surface Transportation, Bridge, Planning, and Research Projects.–
    (1) T4General ruleK.–Subject to paragraph (2), when a State–
      (A)        (i) has obligated all funds apportioned or allocated to it under section 103(e)(4)(H), 104(b)(2), 104(b)(3), 104(f), 144, or 307 of this title, or
        (ii) has used or demonstrates that it will use all obligation authority allocated to it for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction, and
      (B) proceeds with a project funded under such an apportionment or allocation without the aid of Federal funds in accordance with all procedures and all requirements applicable to such a project, except insofar as such procedures and requirements limit the State to implementation of projects with the aid of Federal funds previously apportioned or allocated to it or limit a State to implementation of a project with obligation authority previously allocated to it for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction,
     the Secretary, upon approval of an application of the State, is authorized to pay to the State the Federal share of the cost of the project when additional funds are apportioned or allocated to the State under such section or when additional obligation authority is allocated to it.
    (2) T4Plans, specifications, and applicable standardsK.–The Secretary may only make payments to a State with respect to a project if–
      (A) prior to commencement of the project the Secretary approves the project in the same manner as the Secretary approves other projects, and
      (B) the project conforms to the applicable standards under this title.
  (b) T4Interstate and National Highway System Projects.–
    (1) T4In generalK.–When a State proceeds to construct any project on the National Highway System or the Interstate System without the aid of Federal funds in accordance with all procedures and all requirements applicable to such a project, except insofar as such procedures and requirements limit the State to the construction of projects with the aid of Federal funds previously apportioned to it, the Secretary, upon approval of application of the State, is authorized to pay to the State the Federal share of the cost of construction of the project when additional funds are apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(1) or 104(b)(5), as the case may be, if–
      (A) prior to the construction of the project the Secretary approves the plans and specifications therefor in the same manner as other projects, and
      (B) the project conforms to the applicable standards under section 109 of this title.
    (2) T4Bond interest for projects under construction on january 1, 1983K.–For any project under construction on January 1, 1983, on the Interstate System and converted to a regularly funded project after January 1, 1983, for which the proceeds of bonds issued by the State, county, city, or other political subdivision of the State were used, any interest earned and payable on such bonds by the date of conversion is an eligible cost of construction, to the extent that the proceeds of such bonds have actually been expended in the construction of such projects.
    (3) T4Bond interestK.–Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the cost of construction of a project, the Federal share of which the Secretary is authorized to pay under this subsection, shall include the amount of any interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State to the extent that the proceeds of such bonds have actually been expended in the construction of such project. In no event shall the amount of interest considered as a cost of construction of a project under the preceding sentence be greater than the excess of (A) the amount which would be the estimated cost of construction of the project if the project were to be constructed at the time the project is converted to a regularly funded project, over (B) the actual cost of construction of such project (not including such interest). The Secretary shall consider changes in construction cost indices in determining the amount under clause (A) of this paragraph.
  (c) T4Completion of ProjectsK.–In determining the apportionment for any fiscal year under the provisions of section 103(e)(4), 104, 134, 144,,\1\N or 307 of this title, any such project constructed by a State without the aid of Federal funds shall not be considered completed until an application under the provisions of this section with respect to such project has been approved by the Secretary.
  (d) T4Limitation on Advanced FundingK.–The Secretary may not approve an application under this section unless an authorization for section 103(e)(4), 104, 144, or 307 of this title, as the case may be, is in effect for the fiscal year for which the application is sought beyond the currently authorized funds for each State. No applications may be approved which will exceed the State“s expected apportionment of such authorizations.
