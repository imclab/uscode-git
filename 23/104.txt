  (a) Whenever an apportionment is made of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System, the Secretary shall deduct a sum, in such amount not to exceed 3\3/4\ per centum of all sums so authorized as the Secretary may deem necessary for administering the provisions of law to be financed from appropriations for the Federal-aid systems and for carrying on the research authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of section 307 of this title. In making such determination, the Secretary shall take into account the unexpended balance of any sums deducted for such purposes in prior years. The sum so deducted shall be available for expenditure from the unexpended balance of any appropriation made at any time for expenditure upon the Federal-aid systems, until such sum has been expended.
  (b) On October 1, of each fiscal year except as provided in paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection, the Secretary, after making the deduction authorized by subsection (a) of this section and the set asides authorized by subsection (f) of this section and section 307 of this title, shall apportion the remainder of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System for that fiscal year, among the several States in the following manner:
    (1) T4National highway systemK.–For the National Highway System 1 percent to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and the remaining 99 percent apportioned in the same ratio as funds are apportioned under paragraph (3).
    (2) T4Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement programK.–For the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, in the ratio which the weighted nonattainment area population of each State bears to the total weighted nonattainment area population of all States. The weighted nonattainment area population shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each area within any State that was a nonattainment area (as defined in section 171(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501(2))) for ozone during any part of fiscal year 1994 by a factor of–
      (A) 1.0 if the area is classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment area under subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act;
      (B) 1.1 if the area is classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;
      (C) 1.2 if the area is classified as a serious ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;
      (D) 1.3 if the area is classified as a severe ozone nonattainment area under such subpart; or
      (E) 1.4 if the area is classified as an extreme ozone nonattainment area under such subpart.
         If the area was also classified under subpart 3 of part D of title I of such Act as a nonattainment area for carbon monoxide during any part of fiscal year 1994, for purposes of calculating the weighted nonattainment area population, the weighted nonattainment area population of the area, as determined under the preceding provisions of this paragraph, shall be further multiplied by a factor of 1.2. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, in the case of States with a total 1990 census population of 15,000,000 or greater, the amount apportioned under this paragraph in a fiscal year to all of such States in the aggregate, shall be distributed among such States based on their relative populations; except that none of such States shall be distributed more than 42 percent of the aggregate amount so apportioned to all of such States. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, each State shall receive a minimum apportionment of \1/2\ of 1 percent of the funds apportioned under this paragraph. The Secretary shall use estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce when determining population figures.
    (3) T4Surface transportation program.–
      (A) T4General ruleK.–For the surface transportation program in a manner so that a State“s current percentage share of apportionments is equal to the State“s 1987–1991 percentage share of apportionments. For purposes of this paragraph–
        (i) a State“s current percentage share of apportionments is the State“s percentage share of all funds apportioned for a fiscal year under paragraph (1) for the National Highway System, under section 144 for the bridge program, under paragraph (5)(B) for Interstate maintenance, and under this paragraph; and
        (ii) a State“s 1987–1991 percentage share of apportionments is the State“s percentage share of all apportionments and allocations under this title for fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991 (except apportionments and allocations for Interstate construction under sections 104(b)(5)(A) and 118, Interstate highway substitute under section 103(e)(4), Federal lands highways under section 202, and emergency relief under section 125, all allocations under section 149 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, and the portion of allocations under section 157 (relating to minimum allocation) that would be attributable to apportionments made under Interstate construction and Interstate highway substitute programs under sections 104(b)(5)(A) and 103(e)(4), respectively, for such fiscal years if the minimum allocation percentage for such fiscal years had been 90 percent instead of 85 percent).
      (B) T4Calculation rulesK.–In calculating a State“s percentage share under this paragraph for the purpose of making apportionments for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, each State shall be treated as having received \1/2\ of 1 percent of all funds apportioned for the Interstate construction program under section 104(b)(5)(A) in fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, in any fiscal year no State shall receive a percentage of total apportionments and allocations that is less than 70 percent of its percentage of total apportionments and allocations for fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991, except for those States that receive an apportionment for Interstate construction under paragraph (5)(A) of more than $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1992.
    (4) For the Interstate System, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1957, June 30, 1958, and June 30, 1959:
       One-half in the ratio which the population of each State bears to the total population of all the States as shown by the latest available Federal census, except that no States shall receive less than three-fourths of 1 per centum of the funds so apportioned; and one-half in the manner provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The sums authorized by section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1958, and June 30, 1959, shall be apportioned on a date not less than six months and not more than twelve months in advance of the beginning of the fiscal year for which authorized.

    (3) The funds apportioned to any State under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be made available by the State to the metropolitan planning organizations responsible for carrying out the provisions of section 134 of this title, except that States receiving the minimum apportionment under paragraph (2) may, in addition, subject to the approval of the Secretary, use the funds apportioned to finance transportation planning outside of urbanized areas. These funds shall be matched in accordance with section 120(j) \3\N of this title unless the Secretary determines that the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served without such matching.
    (4) The distribution within any State of the planning funds made available to agencies under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be in accordance with a formula developed by each State and approved by the Secretary which shall consider but not necessarily be limited to, population, status of planning, attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of section 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law.
    (5) T4Determination of population figuresK.–For the purposes of determining population figures under this subsection, the Secretary shall use the most recent estimate published by the Secretary of Commerce.

The Secretary may approve the transfer of 100 per centum of the apportionment under one such section to the apportionment under any other of such sections if such transfer is requested by the State highway department, and is approved by the Secretary as being in the public interest, if he has received satisfactory assurances from such State highway department that the purposes of the program from which such funds are to be transferred have been met. A State may transfer not to exceed 50 percent of the State“s apportionment under section 144 in any fiscal year to the apportionment of such State under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(3) of this section. Any transfer to subsection (b)(3) shall not be subject to section 133(d). Nothing in this subsection authorizes the transfer of any amount apportioned from the Highway Trust Fund to any apportionment the funds for which were not from the Highway Trust Fund, and nothing in this subsection authorizes the transfer of any amount apportioned from funds not from the Highway Trust Fund to any apportionment the funds for which were from the Highway Trust Fund.
