  (a) T4EstablishmentK.–The Secretary shall establish and implement a congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program in accordance with this section.
  (b) T4Eligible ProjectsK.–Except as provided in subsection (c), a State may obligate funds apportioned to it under section 104(b)(2) for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program only for a transportation project or program if the project or program is for an area in the State that is or was designated as a nonattainment area for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter under section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)) and classified pursuant to section 181(a), 186(a), 188(a), or 188(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511(a), 7512(a), 7513(a), or 7513(b)) or is or was designated as a nonattainment area under such section 107(d) after December 31, 1997, and–
    (1)      (A) if the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines, on the basis of information published by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (other than clause (xvi) of such section), that the project or program is likely to contribute to–
        (i) the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard; or
        (ii) the maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard in a maintenance area; or
      (B) in any case in which such information is not available, if the Secretary, after such consultation, determines that the project or program is part of a program, method, or strategy described in such section;
    (2) if the project or program is included in a State implementation plan that has been approved pursuant to the Clean Air Act and the project will have air quality benefits;
    (3) the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines that the project or program is likely to contribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard, whether through reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, or through other factors;
    (4) to establish or operate a traffic monitoring, management, and control facility or program if the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines that the facility or program is likely to contribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard; or
    (5) if the program or project improves traffic flow, including projects to improve signalization, construct high occupancy vehicle lanes, improve intersections, and implement intelligent transportation system strategies and such other projects that are eligible for assistance under this section on the day before the date of enactment of this paragraph.
       No funds may be provided under this section for a project which will result in the construction of new capacity available to single occupant vehicles unless the project consists of a high occupancy vehicle facility available to single occupant vehicles only at other than peak travel times. In areas of a State which are nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, or both, and for PM–10 resulting from transportation activities, the State may obligate such funds for any project or program under paragraph (1) or (2) without regard to any limitation of the Department of Transportation relating to the type of ambient air quality standard such project or program addresses.
  (c) T4States Receiving Minimum Apportionment.–
    (1) T4States without a nonattainment areaK.–If a State does not have, and never has had, a nonattainment area designated under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the State may use funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(2) for any project eligible under the surface transportation program under section 133.
    (2) T4States with a nonattainment areaK.–If a State has a nonattainment area or maintenance area and receives funds under section 104(b)(2)(D) above the amount of funds that the State would have received based on its nonattainment and maintenance area population under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 104(b)(2), the State may use that portion of the funds not based on its nonattainment and maintenance area population under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 104(b)(2) for any project in the State eligible under section 133.
  (d) T4Applicability of Planning RequirementsK.–Programming and expenditure of funds for projects under this section shall be consistent with the requirements of sections 134 and 135 of this title.
  (e) T4Partnerships With Nongovernmental Entities.–
    (1) T4In generalK.–Notwithstanding any other provision of this title and in accordance with this subsection, a metropolitan planning organization, State transportation department, or other project sponsor may enter into an agreement with any public, private, or nonprofit entity to cooperatively implement any project carried out under this section.
    (2) T4Forms of participation by entitiesK.–Participation by an entity under paragraph (1) may consist of–
      (A) ownership or operation of any land, facility, vehicle, or other physical asset associated with the project;
      (B) cost sharing of any project expense;
      (C) carrying out of administration, construction management, project management, project operation, or any other management or operational duty associated with the project; and
      (D) any other form of participation approved by the Secretary.
    (3) T4Allocation to entitiesK.–A State may allocate funds apportioned under section 104(b)(2) to an entity described in paragraph (1).
    (4) T4Alternative fuel projectsK.–In the case of a project that will provide for the use of alternative fuels by privately owned vehicles or vehicle fleets, activities eligible for funding under this subsection–
      (A) may include the costs of vehicle refueling infrastructure, including infrastructure that would support the development, production, and use of emerging technologies that reduce emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles, and other capital investments associated with the project;
      (B) shall include only the incremental cost of an alternative fueled vehicle, as compared to a conventionally fueled vehicle, that would otherwise be borne by a private party; and
      (C) shall apply other governmental financial purchase contributions in the calculation of net incremental cost.
    (5) T4Prohibition on federal participation with respect to required activitiesK.–A Federal participation payment under this subsection may not be made to an entity to fund an obligation imposed under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or any other Federal law.
