    (2) T4Life-cycle cost analysis definedK.–In this subsection, the term ””life-cycle cost analysis““ means a process for evaluating the total economic worth of a usable project segment by analyzing initial costs and discounted future costs, such as maintenance, user costs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, restoring, and resurfacing costs, over the life of the project segment.
  (g) T4Value Engineering for NHS.–
    (1) T4RequirementK.–The Secretary shall establish a program to require States to carry out a value engineering analysis for all projects on the National Highway System with an estimated total cost of $25,000,000 or more.
    (2) T4Value engineering definedK.–In this subsection, the term ””value engineering analysis““ means a systematic process of review and analysis of a project during its design phase by a multidisciplined team of persons not involved in the project in order to provide suggestions for reducing the total cost of the project and providing a project of equal or better quality.
