   The Congress finds that–
  (1) the Nation“s urban centers are facing increasingly pressing problems and needs in the areas of economic development, community infrastructure and service, social policy, public health, housing, crime, education, environmental concerns, planning and work force preparation;
  (2) there are, in the Nation“s urban institutions, people with underutilized skills, knowledge, and experience who are capable of providing a vast range of services toward the amelioration of the problems described in paragraph (1);
  (3) the skills, knowledge and experience in these urban institutions, if applied in a systematic and sustained manner, can make a significant contribution to the solution of such problems; and
  (4) the application of such skills, knowledge and experience is hindered by the limited funds available to redirect attention to solutions to such urban problems.
