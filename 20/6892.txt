   The Congress finds that–
  (1) the Star Schools program has helped to encourage the use of distance learning strategies to serve multi-State regions primarily by means of satellite and broadcast television;
  (2) in general, distance learning programs have been used effectively to provide students in small, rural, and isolated schools with courses and instruction, such as science and foreign language instruction, that the local educational agency is not otherwise able to provide; and
  (3) distance learning programs may also be used to–
    (A) provide students of all ages in all types of schools and educational settings with greater access to high-quality instruction in the full range of core academic subjects that will enable such students to meet challenging, internationally competitive, educational standards;
    (B) expand professional development opportunities for teachers;
    (C) contribute to achievement of the National Education Goals; and
    (D) expand learning opportunities for everyone.
