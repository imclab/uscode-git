      (B) If a State has State content standards or State student performance standards developed under title III of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5881 et seq.] and an aligned set of assessments for all students developed under such title, or, if not developed under such title, adopted under another process, the State shall use such standards and assessments, modified, if necessary, to conform with the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (D) of this paragraph, and paragraphs (2) and (3).
      (C) If a State has not adopted State content standards and State student performance standards for all students, the State plan shall include a strategy and schedule for developing State content standards and State student performance standards for elementary and secondary school children served under this part in subjects as determined by the State, but including at least mathematics and reading or language arts by the end of the one-year period described in paragraph (6), which standards shall include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of performance expected of all children.
      (D) Standards under this paragraph shall include–
        (i) challenging content standards in academic subjects that–
          (I) specify what children are expected to know and be able to do;
          (II) contain coherent and rigorous content; and
          (III) encourage the teaching of advanced skills;
        (ii) challenging student performance standards that–
          (I) are aligned with the State“s content standards;
          (II) describe two levels of high performance, proficient and advanced, that determine how well children are mastering the material in the State content standards; and
          (III) describe a third level of performance, partially proficient, to provide complete information about the progress of the lower performing children toward achieving to the proficient and advanced levels of performance.
      (E) For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed such standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that such students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations as are all children.
    (2) Yearly progress
      (A) Each State plan shall demonstrate, based on assessments described under paragraph (3), what constitutes adequate yearly progress of–
        (i) any school served under this part toward enabling children to meet the State“s student performance standards; and
        (ii) any local educational agency that received funds under this part toward enabling children in schools receiving assistance under this part to meet the State“s student performance standards.
      (B) Adequate yearly progress shall be defined in a manner–
        (i) that is consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary that result in continuous and substantial yearly improvement of each local educational agency and school sufficient to achieve the goal of all children served under this part meeting the State“s proficient and advanced levels of performance, particularly economically disadvantaged and limited English proficient children; and
        (ii) that links progress primarily to performance on the assessments carried out under this section while permitting progress to be established in part through the use of other measures.
    (3) Assessments
       Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed or adopted a set of high-quality, yearly student assessments, including assessments in at least mathematics and reading or language arts, that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each local educational agency and school served under this part in enabling all children served under this part to meet the State“s student performance standards. Such assessments shall–
      (A) be the same assessments used to measure the performance of all children, if the State measures the performance of all children;
      (B) be aligned with the State“s challenging content and student performance standards and provide coherent information about student attainment of such standards;
      (C) be used for purposes for which such assessments are valid and reliable, and be consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards for such assessments;
      (D) measure the proficiency of students in the academic subjects in which a State has adopted challenging content and student performance standards and be administered at some time during–
        (i) grades 3 through 5;
        (ii) grades 6 through 9; and
        (iii) grades 10 through 12;

        (ii) the reasonable adaptations and accommodations for students with diverse learning needs, necessary to measure the achievement of such students relative to State content standards; and
        (iii) the inclusion of limited English proficient students who shall be assessed, to the extent practicable, in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what such students know and can do, to determine such students“ mastery of skills in subjects other than English;
      (G) include students who have attended schools in a local educational agency for a full academic year but have not attended a single school for a full academic year, however the performance of students who have attended more than one school in the local educational agency in any academic year shall be used only in determining the progress of the local educational agency;
      (H) provide individual student interpretive and descriptive reports, which shall include scores, or other information on the attainment of student performance standards; and
        (I) enable results to be disaggregated within each State, local educational agency, and school by gender, by each major racial and ethnic group, by English proficiency status, by migrant status, by students with disabilities as compared to nondisabled students, and by economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged.
    (4) Special rule
