  (a) Of the funds provided by the State agency to eligible recipients, at least 95 percent must be expended for provision of adult education instructional activities. The remainder shall be used for planning, administration, personnel development, and interagency coordination.
  (b) In cases where the administrative cost limits under subsection (a) of this section would be insufficient for adequate planning, administration, evaluation, and coordination of programs supported under this Act, the State agency shall negotiate with the local grant recipient in order to determine an adequate level of funds to be used for noninstructional purposes.
