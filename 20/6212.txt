      (A) if, and only to the extent that, the Secretary of Education determines that such requirement impedes the ability of the State or a local partnership to carry out the purposes of this chapter;

        (iv) such other information as the Secretary of Education may require;
      (C) if the State waives, or agrees to waive, similar requirements of State law; and
      (D) if the State–

        (ii) provides, to the extent feasible, to students, parents, advocacy and civil rights groups, and labor and business organizations an opportunity to comment on the proposal of the State to seek a waiver; and
