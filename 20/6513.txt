      (C) identify any such rule, regulation, or policy as a State-imposed requirement.
    (2) Support and facilitation
       State rules, regulations, and policies under this subchapter shall support and facilitate local educational agency and school-level systemic reform designed to enable all children to meet the challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards.
