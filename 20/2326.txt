  (a) In general
     Each State board receiving assistance under this chapter shall conduct an assessment using measurable objective criteria developed by the State board to assess program quality. Such criteria shall be developed in consultation with representatives of the groups described in section 2325(a) of this title and shall use information gathered by the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee and, if appropriate, other information. Each State board shall widely disseminate such criteria. State boards shall develop such criteria no later than the beginning of the 1991–1992 school year. Such criteria shall include such factors as–
    (1) integration of academic and vocational education;
    (2) sequential course of study leading to both academic and occupational competencies;
    (3) increased student work skill attainment and job placement;
    (4) increased linkages between secondary and postsecondary educational institutions;
    (5) instruction and experience, to the extent practicable, in all aspects of the industry the students are preparing to enter;
    (6) the ability of the eligible recipients to meet the needs of special populations with respect to vocational education;
    (7) raising the quality of vocational education programs in schools with high concentrations of poor and low-achieving students;
    (8) the relevance of programs to the workplace and to the occupations for which students are to be trained, and the extent to which such programs reflect a realistic assessment of current and future labor market needs, including needs in areas of emerging technologies;
    (9) the ability of the vocational curriculum, equipment, and instructional materials to meet the demands of the workforce;
    (10) basic and higher order current and future workplace competencies which will reflect the hiring needs of employers; and
    (11) other factors considered appropriate by the State board.
  (b) Deadline for assessment
     Each State board shall complete the assessment required by subsection (a) of this section before the expiration of the 6-month period beginning on September 25, 1990.
