Parental consent for evaluation shall not be construed as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services.
        (ii) Refusal
           If the parents of such child refuse consent for the evaluation, the agency may continue to pursue an evaluation by utilizing the mediation and due process procedures under section 1415 of this title, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to parental consent.
    (2) Reevaluations
       A local educational agency shall ensure that a reevaluation of each child with a disability is conducted–

    (2) Conduct of evaluation
       In conducting the evaluation, the local educational agency shall–
      (A) use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional and developmental information, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining whether the child is a child with a disability and the content of the child“s individualized education program, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general curriculum or, for preschool children, to participate in appropriate activities;
      (B) not use any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and

       Each local educational agency shall ensure that–
      (A) tests and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under this section–
        (i) are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis; and

      (B) a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility will be given to the parent.
    (5) Special rule for eligibility determination
       In making a determination of eligibility under paragraph (4)(A), a child shall not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor for such determination is lack of instruction in reading or math or limited English proficiency.
  (c) Additional requirements for evaluation and reevaluations
    (1) Review of existing evaluation data
       As part of an initial evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this section, the IEP Team described in subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, shall–

       Each local educational agency shall obtain informed parental consent, in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability, except that such informed parent consent need not be obtained if the local educational agency can demonstrate that it had taken reasonable measures to obtain such consent and the child“s parent has failed to respond.
    (4) Requirements if additional data are not needed
