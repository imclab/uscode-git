      (B) the President transmits a document to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing a copy of the text of such requirement, amendment, or recommendation, together with–

      (C) the bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.
    (3) Recommendations as to application
       The President may make the same type of recommendations, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions, to the Congress with respect to the application of any such requirement, amendment, or recommendation as he may make, under section 2112(f) of this title, with respect to a trade agreement.

      (B) the term ””implementing bill““ or ””implementing revenue bill““, whichever is appropriate, shall be treated as a reference to the bill submitted by the President.
  (d) Unspecified private remedies not created
