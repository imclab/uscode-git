      (A) Any tribe, or its designee, which has students in attendance at a local educational agency may, in its discretion and without regard to the requirements of any other provision of law, file a written complaint with the Secretary regarding any action of a local educational agency taken pursuant to, or relevant to, the requirements of this section.
      (B) Within ten working days from receipt of a complaint, the Secretary shall–
        (i) designate a time and place for a hearing into the matters relating to the complaint at a location in close proximity to the local educational agency involved, or if the Secretary determines there is good cause, at some other location convenient to both the tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency;
        (ii) designate a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing; and
        (iii) notify the affected tribe or tribes and the local educational agency involved of the time, place, and nature of the hearing and send copies of the complaint to the local educational agency and the affected tribe or tribes.

    (8) Withholding
       If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary, or if the remedy required is not undertaken within the time established and the Secretary determines that an extension of the time established will not effectively encourage the remedy required, the Secretary shall withhold payment of all moneys to which such local agency is eligible under section 7703 of this title until such time as the remedy required is undertaken, except where the complaining tribe or its designee formally requests that such funds be released to the local educational agency, except that the Secretary may not withhold such moneys during the course of the school year if the Secretary determines that such withholding would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the local educational agency.
    (9) Rejection of determination
       If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary and a tribe exercises the option under section 1101(d) of the Education Amendments of 1978, to have education services provided either directly by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or by contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, any Indian students affiliated with that tribe who wish to remain in attendance at the local educational agency against whom the complaint which led to the tribal action under such subsection (d) of this section was lodged may be counted with respect to that local educational agency for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title. In such event, funds under such section shall not be withheld pursuant to paragraph (8) and no further complaints with respect to such students may be filed under paragraph (1).
  (f) Construction
