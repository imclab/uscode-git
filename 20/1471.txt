  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need–
    (1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay,
    (2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation“s schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age,
    (3) to minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independent living in society,
    (4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities, and
    (5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of historically underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner-city, and rural populations.
  (b) Policy
     It is therefore the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States–
    (1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency program of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families,
    (2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage), and
    (3) to enhance their capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.
