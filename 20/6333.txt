  (a) Amount of grants
    (1) Grants for local educational agencies and Puerto Rico
       The grant which a local educational agency in a State is eligible to receive under this subpart for a fiscal year shall (except as provided in section 6337 of this title), be determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section by 40 percent of the amount determined under the next sentence. The amount determined under this sentence shall be the average per pupil expenditure in the State except that–
      (A) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is less than 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States; or
      (B) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is more than 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.
    (2) Basis for calculating grants
       For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than section 6334 of this title) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this subparagraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that–
      (A) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;
      (B) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; or
      (C) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.
        (i) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; and
        (ii) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State“s total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State“s local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflect the current distribution of children in poor families among the State“s local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. If a local educational agency serving an area with total population of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State education agency, then such local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary must respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt.
       In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of population data compiled for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretaries shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In years when grants are calculated by the Secretary on the basis of local educational agency data, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either–
    (3) Puerto Rico
       For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the percentage which the average per pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States. The grant which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this section for a fiscal year shall be the amount arrived at by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of–
      (A) the percentage determined under the preceding sentence; and
      (B) 32 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.
    (4) ””State““ defined
       For purposes of this subsection, the term ””State““ does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.
  (b) Minimum number of children to qualify
     Subject to the succeeding sentence, a local educational agency shall be eligible for a basic grant for a fiscal year under this subpart only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section in the school district of such local educational agency is at least 10. Beginning in fiscal year 1996, no local educational agency shall be eligible for a grant under this section if the number of children counted for grants under this section is equal to 2 percent or less of the total school age population in the local educational agency. For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, grants not made as a result of applying the preceding sentence shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.
  (c) Children to be counted
    (1) Categories of children
       The number of children to be counted for purposes of this section is the aggregate of–
      (A) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency from families below the poverty level as determined under paragraph (2);
      (B) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (5); and
      (C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency in institutions for neglected and delinquent children (other than such institutions operated by the United States), but not counted pursuant to subpart 1 of part D of this subchapter for the purposes of a grant to a State agency, or being supported in foster homes with public funds.
    (2) Determination of number of children
       For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. For fiscal year 1999 and beyond, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency“s total grant that is no less than the county“s share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency“s grant.
    (3) Population updates
       In fiscal year 1997 and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable, taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, they shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In determining the families which are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    (4) Study
      (A) The Secretary of Education shall, within 30 days after October 20, 1994, contract with the National Academy of Sciences (hereafter in this section referred to as the ””Academy““) to study the program to produce intercensal poverty data for small geographic areas and certain age cohorts being developed by the Bureau of the Census.
      (B) In conducting its study, the Academy shall consider such matters as–
        (i) the methodology used to produce and publish intercensal poverty data, and possible alternative methods to improve the usefulness of the data for Federal program purposes;
        (ii) the availability of alternative indicators of poverty for small geographic areas, against which the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census could be compared;
        (iii) the reliability of the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, particularly for less populous geographic areas;
        (iv) the reliability of intercensal poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, as compared over time to similar data produced by the Bureau of the Census during the most recent decennial census; and
        (v) the usefulness of poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census for Federal programs that allocate funds to State and sub-State areas based, in whole or in part, on such data.
      (C) The Academy shall submit to the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce, as well as to the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate–
        (i) not later than 18 months after the date on which a contract is entered into under subsection (a) of this section, and not later than every 18 months thereafter, such interim reports on the Academy“s activities under this chapter that the Academy deems appropriate, including a detailed statement of the Academy“s findings and conclusions with respect to any poverty data which the Bureau of the Census publishes and produces, within 90 days of such publication; and
        (ii) not later than December 31, 1998, a final report which shall include a more detailed statement of the Academy“s findings and conclusions with respect to the use of any intercensal poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census as the basis for allocating Federal funds under this chapter.
      (D) Of the funds appropriated under section 6302(f) of this title, the Secretary shall use such sums as are necessary in each of fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.
    (5) Other children to be counted
       For purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of 4 in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children of such ages living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary“s determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.
    (6) Estimate
       When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph \1\N) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information. For purposes of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.
  (d) State minimum
     Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) or (d) of section 6332 of this title, the aggregate amount allotted for all local educational agencies within a State may not be less than the lesser of–
    (1) 0.25 percent of total grants under this section; or
    (2) the average of–
      (A) one-quarter of 1 percent of the total amount available for such fiscal year under this section; and
      (B) the number of children in such State counted under subsection (c) of this section in the fiscal year multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.
