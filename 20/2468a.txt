  (a) Establishment of Review Committee
     Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, before any State publishes any proposed or final State rule or regulation pursuant to this chapter, the State shall establish and convene a State Committee of Practitioners (in this section referred to as the ””Committee““) for the purpose of reviewing such rule or regulation. The Committee shall be selected from nominees solicited from State organizations representing school administrators, teachers, parents, members of local boards of education, and appropriate representatives of institutions of higher education. The Committee shall consist of–
    (1) representatives of local educational agencies, who shall constitute a majority of the members of the Committee;
    (2) school administrators;
    (3) teachers;
    (4) parents;
    (5) members of local boards of education;
    (6) representatives of institutions of higher education; and
    (7) students.
  (b) Limited exception
     In an emergency, where a regulation must be issued within a very limited time period to assist eligible recipients with the operation of a program, the State may issue a regulation without fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but shall immediately convene the Committee to review the regulation before it is issued in final form.
