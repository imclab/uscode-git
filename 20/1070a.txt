  (a) Program authority and method of distribution
    (1) The Secretary shall, during the period beginning July 1, 1972, and ending September 30, 1998, pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a basic grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students, except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).
    (3) Basic grants made under this subpart shall be known as ””Federal Pell Grants““.
  (b) Purpose and amount of grants
    (1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a basic grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student“s cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087T3llK of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070 \1\N of this title.
    (2)      (A) The amount of the basic grant for a student eligible under this part shall be–
        (i) $3,700 for academic year 1993–1994,
        (ii) $3,900 for academic year 1994–1995,
        (iii) $4,100 for academic year 1995–1996,
        (iv) $4,300 for academic year 1996–1997, and
        (v) $4,500 for academic year 1997–1998,
           less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.
      (B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the basic grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.
    (3)      (A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,400, the amount of a student“s basic grant shall equal $2,400 plus–
        (i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,400; plus
        (ii) the lesser of–
          (I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or
          (II) the sum of the student“s tuition and the student“s allowance determined under subparagraph (B), if applicable.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), a student“s allowance is $750 if the student has dependent care expenses (as defined in section 1087T3llK(8) of this title) or disability related expenses (as defined in section 1087T3llK(9) of this title).
    (4) No basic grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087T3llK of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a basic grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the basic grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the basic grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.
    (5) No basic grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a basic grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a basic grant of $400.
    (6) The Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive 2 Pell grants during a single award year, if–
      (A) the student is enrolled full-time in an associate or baccalaureate degree program of study that is 2 years or longer at an eligible institution that is computed in credit hours; and
      (B) the student completes course work toward completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree that exceeds the requirements for a full academic year as defined by the institution.
    (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the basic grant to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the student“s home institution, except that the amount of such basic grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the grant level specified in the appropriate Appropriation Act for this subpart for such year. If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution“s cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.
    (8) No basic grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution.
  (c) Period of eligibility for grants
    (1) The period during which a student may receive basic grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language instruction) which are determined by the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.
    (3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.
  (d) Applications for grants
    (1) The Secretary shall from time to time set dates by which students shall file applications for basic grants under this subpart.
    (2) Each student desiring a basic grant for any year shall file an application therefor containing such information and assurances as the Secretary may deem necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the functions and responsibilities of this subpart.
  (e) Distribution of grants to students
     Payments under this section shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in such manner as will best accomplish the purpose of this section. Any disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student“s account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student“s account.
  (f) Calculation of eligibility
    (1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a basic grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student. Each such student financial aid administrator shall–
      (A) examine and assess the data used to calculate the expected family contribution of the student furnished pursuant to this subsection;
      (B) recalculate the expected family contribution of the student if there has been a change in circumstances of the student or in the data submitted;
      (C) make the award to the student in the correct amount; and
      (D) after making such award report the corrected data to such contractor and to a central processor (if any) designated by the Secretary for a confirmation of the correct computation of amount of the expected family contribution for each such student.
    (2) Whenever a student receives an award under this subpart that, due to recalculation errors by the institution of higher education, is in excess of the amount which the student is entitled to receive under this subpart, such institution of higher education shall pay to the Secretary the amount of such excess unless such excess can be resolved in a subsequent disbursement to the institution.
    (3) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart shall for each academic year after academic year 1986–1987 prepare and submit a report to the Secretary on the correctness of the computations of amount of the expected family contribution, and on the accuracy of the questions on the application form under this subpart for the previous academic year for which the contractor is responsible. The Secretary shall transmit the report, together with the comments and recommendations of the Secretary, to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives.
  (g) Insufficient appropriations
     If, for any fiscal year, the funds appropriated for payments under this subpart are insufficient to satisfy fully all entitlements, as calculated under subsection (b) of this section (but at the maximum grant level specified in such appropriation), the Secretary shall promptly transmit a notice of such insufficiency to each House of the Congress, and identify in such notice the additional amount that would be required to be appropriated to satisfy fully all entitlements (as so calculated at such maximum grant level).
  (h) Use of excess funds
    (1) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by 15 percent or less, then all of the excess funds shall remain available for making payments under this subpart during the next succeeding fiscal year.
    (2) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by more than 15 percent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making such payments but payments may be made under this paragraph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.
      (i) Treatment of institutions and students under other laws
         Any institution of higher education which enters into an agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive under this subpart shall not be deemed, by virtue of such agreement, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of subtitle D of title V of Public Law 100–690 [41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.].
