     The Secretary shall provide, on the basis of the need and the eligibility of students at each participating institution, and parents of such students, for such loans, funds for student and parent loans under this part–
    (1) directly to an institution of higher education that has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1087d(a) of this title to participate in the direct student loan programs under this part and that also has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1087d(b) of this title to originate loans under this part; or
    (2) through an alternative originator designated by the Secretary to students (and parents of students) attending institutions of higher education that have an agreement with the Secretary under section 1087d(a) of this title but that do not have an agreement with the Secretary under section 1087d(b) of this title.
  (b) Fees for origination services
    (1) Fees for institutions
       The Secretary shall pay fees to institutions of higher education (or a consortium of such institutions) with agreements under section 1087d(b) of this title, in an amount established by the Secretary, to assist in meeting the costs of loan origination. Such fees–
      (A) shall be paid by the Secretary based on all the loans made under this part to a particular borrower in the same academic year;
      (B) shall be subject to a sliding scale that decreases the per borrower amount of such fees as the number of borrowers increases; and
      (C)        (i) for academic year 1994–1995, shall not exceed a program-wide average of $10 per borrower for all the loans made under this part to such borrower in the same academic year; and
        (ii) for succeeding academic years, shall not exceed such average fee as the Secretary shall establish pursuant to regulations.
    (2) Fees for alternative originators
       The Secretary shall pay fees for loan origination services to alternative originators of loans made under this part in an amount established by the Secretary in accordance with the terms of the contract described in section 1087f(b) of this title between the Secretary and each such alternative originator.
  (c) No entitlement to participate or originate
     No institution of higher education shall have a right to participate in the programs authorized by this part, to originate loans, or to perform any program function under this part. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed so as to limit the entitlement of an eligible student attending a participating institution (or the eligible parent of such student) to borrow under this part.
  (d) Delivery of loan funds
     Loan funds shall be paid and delivered to an institution by the Secretary prior to the beginning of the payment period established by the Secretary in a manner that is consistent with payment and delivery of basic grants under subpart 1 of part A of this subchapter.
