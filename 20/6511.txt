    (2) Meetings and electronic exchange
       Such advice and recommendation may be obtained through such mechanisms as regional meetings and electronic exchanges of information.

       After obtaining such advice and recommendations, and prior to publishing proposed regulations, the Secretary shall–
      (A) establish a negotiated rulemaking process on a minimum of two key issues, including–
        (i) schoolwide programs; and
        (ii) standards and assessment;
      (B) select individuals to participate in such process from among individuals or groups which provided advice and recommendations, including representation from all geographic regions of the United States; and

       In an emergency situation in which regulations to carry out this subchapter must be issued with a very limited time to assist State and local educational agencies with the operation of a program under this subchapter, the Secretary may issue proposed regulations without following such process but shall, immediately thereafter and prior to issuing final regulations, conduct regional meetings to review such proposed regulations.
  (c) Limitation
     Regulations to carry out this part may not require local programs to follow a particular instructional model, such as the provision of services outside the regular classroom or school program.
