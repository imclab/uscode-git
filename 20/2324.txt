  (a) In general
     The State board shall develop the portion of each State plan relating to the amount and uses of any funds proposed to be reserved for adult education, postsecondary education, tech-prep education, and secondary education after consultation with the State agency responsible for supervision of community colleges, technical institutes, or other 2-year postsecondary institutions primarily engaged in providing postsecondary vocational education, and the State agency responsible for secondary education. The State board shall, in developing such plan, take into consideration the relative training and retraining needs of secondary, adult, and postsecondary students, and shall include the State“s rationale for distribution of funds. If a State agency finds that a portion of the final State plan is objectionable, such agency shall file such objections with the State board. The State board shall respond to any objections of such agency in submitting such plan to the Secretary. The Secretary shall consider such comments in reviewing the State plan.
  (b) Time for submission; approval
     Each State plan shall be submitted to the Secretary by May 1 preceding the beginning of the first fiscal year for which such plan is to be in effect. The Secretary shall approve each plan before the expiration of the 60-day period beginning on the date the plan is submitted, if the plan meets the requirements of section 2323 of this title and is of sufficient quality to meet the objectives of this chapter (including the objective of developing and implementing program evaluations and improvements), and shall subsequently take appropriate actions to monitor the State“s compliance with the provisions of its plan and the requirements of this chapter on a regular basis. The Secretary shall not finally disapprove a State plan except after giving reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the State board.
