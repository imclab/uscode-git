  (a) Investigation by International Trade Commission; report; publication
    (1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon request of the President or the United States Trade Representative, upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the International Trade Commission (hereafter in this section referred to as the ””Commission““) shall promptly make an investigation to determine, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, whether market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry.
    (2) The provisions of subsections (a)(3), (b)(4),\1\N and (c)(4) of section 2252 of this title shall apply with respect to investigations by the Commission under paragraph (1).
    (3) The Commission shall report to the President its determination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dissenting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.
    (4) The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.
  (b) Affirmative determination
     With respect to any affirmative determination of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section–
    (1) such determination shall be treated as an affirmative determination made under section 2251(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988); and
    (2) sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;
       except that–
      (A) the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and
      (B) if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.
  (c) Products of Communist countries
     If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a) of this section. If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) of this section as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a) of this section. Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission“s report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.
  (d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements
    (1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2251(a)(1) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.
    (2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.
  (e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption
     For purposes of this section–
    (1) The term ””Communist country““ means any country dominated or controlled by communism.
    (2)      (A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):
        (i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.
        (ii) The term ””significant cause““ refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.
      (C) The Commission, in determining whether market disruption exists, shall consider, among other factors–
        (i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;
        (ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;
        (iii) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of like or directly competitive articles; and
        (iv) evidence of disruptive pricing practices, or other efforts to unfairly manage trade patterns.
