  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds that–
    (1) because more than one-half of all first-time first-year students attending postsecondary institutions attend community or junior colleges, and because almost one-half of minority students enrolled in higher education attend 2-year institutions, community and junior colleges represent a substantial and an important educational resource;
    (2) declining participation rates for low-income students and minorities at institutions of higher education is of growing concern to the higher education community and Congress; and
    (3) there is growing awareness of the need to assist low-income, minority and other nontraditional students in bridging the gap between 2-year to 4-year institutions, enabling such students to reach their individual potential, as well as contribute to the larger society.
  (b) Purpose
     The purpose of this part is to improve the educational opportunities of this Nation“s postsecondary students by creating comprehensive articulation agreements and planning between partnerships of 2-year and 4-year institutions of higher education.
