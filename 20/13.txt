   For the purpose of cooperating with the States in paying the salaries of teachers of trade, home economics, and industrial subjects there is annually appropriated for the use of the States the sum of $3,000,000. Said appropriation shall be allotted to the States in the proportion which their urban population bears to the total urban population in the United States, not including outlying possessions, according to the last preceding United States census. The allotment of funds to any State shall be not less than a minimum of $10,000 for any fiscal year. There is appropriated the sum of $50,000 annually, or so much thereof as may be needed, which shall be used for the purpose of providing the minimum allotment to the States provided for in this section.
   Not more than 20 per centum of the money appropriated under this chapter for the payment of salaries of teachers of trade, home economics, and industrial subjects, for any year, shall be expended for the salaries of teachers of home economics subjects.
