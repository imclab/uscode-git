  (a) Short title
     This chapter may be cited as the ””Individuals with Disabilities Education Act““.
  (b) Findings
     The Congress finds that–
    (1) there are more than eight million children with disabilities in the United States today;
    (2) the special educational needs of such children are not being fully met;
    (3) more than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity;
    (4) one million of the children with disabilities in the United States are excluded entirely from the public school system and will not go through the educational process with their peers;
    (5) there are many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevent them from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities are undetected;
    (6) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families are often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense;
    (7) developments in the training of teachers and in diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods have advanced to the point that, given appropriate funding, State and local educational agencies can and will provide effective special education and related services to meet the needs of children with disabilities;
    (8) State and local educational agencies have a responsibility to provide education for all children with disabilities, but present financial resources are inadequate to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities; and
    (9) it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities in order to assure equal protection of the law.
  (c) Purpose
     It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, within the time periods specified in section 1412(2)(B) of this title, a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.
