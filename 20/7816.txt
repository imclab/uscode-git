  (a) In general
     The Secretary shall require that, as part of an application for a grant under this subpart, each applicant shall maintain a file, with respect to each Indian child for whom the local educational agency provides a free public education, that contains a form that sets forth information establishing the status of the child as an Indian child eligible for assistance under this subpart and that otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.
  (b) Forms
    (1) In general
       The form described in subsection (a) of this section shall include–
      (A) either–
        (i)          (I) the name of the tribe or band of Indians (as defined in section 7881(4) of this title) with respect to which the child claims membership;
          (II) the enrollment number establishing the membership of the child (if readily available); and
          (III) the name and address of the organization that maintains updated and accurate membership data for such tribe or band of Indians; or
        (ii) if the child is not a member of a tribe or band of Indians, the name, the enrollment number (if readily available), and the organization (and address thereof) responsible for maintaining updated and accurate membership rolls of any parent or grandparent of the child from whom the child claims eligibility;
      (B) a statement of whether the tribe or band of Indians with respect to which the child, parent or grandparent of the child claims membership is federally recognized;
      (C) the name and address of the parent or legal guardian of the child;
      (D) a signature of the parent or legal guardian of the child that verifies the accuracy of the information supplied; and
      (E) any other information that the Secretary considers necessary to provide an accurate program profile.
    (2) Minimum information
       In order for a child to be eligible to be counted for the purpose of computing the amount of a grant award made under section 7813 of this title, an eligibility form prepared pursuant to this section for a child shall include–

      (C) the dated signature of the parent or guardian of the child.
    (3) Failure
       The failure of an applicant to furnish any information described in this subsection other than the information described in paragraph (2) with respect to any child shall have no bearing on the determination of whether the child is an eligible Indian child for the purposes of determining the amount of a grant award made under section 7813 of this title.
  (c) Statutory construction
     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect a definition contained in section 7881 of this title.
  (d) Forms and standards of proof

    (1) to establish such eligibility; and
    (2) to meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.
  (e) Documentation
     For purposes of determining whether a child is eligible to be counted for the purpose of computing the amount of a grant under section 7813 of this title, the membership of the child, or any parent or grandparent of the child, in a tribe or band of Indians may be established by proof other than an enrollment number, notwithstanding the availability of an enrollment number for a member of such tribe or band. Nothing in subsection (b) of this section shall be construed to require the furnishing of an enrollment number.

    (1) In general
      (A) For each fiscal year, in order to provide such information as is necessary to carry out the responsibility of the Secretary to provide technical assistance under this subpart, the Secretary shall conduct a monitoring and evaluation review of a sampling of the recipients of grants under this subpart. The sampling conducted under this subparagraph shall take into account size of the local educational agency and the geographic location of such agency.
      (B) A local educational agency may not be held liable to the United States or be subject to any penalty, by reason of the findings of an audit that relates to the date of completion, or the date of submission, of any forms used to establish, before April 28, 1988, the eligibility of a child for entitlement under the Indian Elementary and Secondary School Assistance Act.
    (2) False information

      (B) be liable to the United States for any funds that have not been expended.
    (3) Excluded children
       A student who provides false information for the form required under subsection (d) of this section shall not be counted for the purpose of computing the amount of a grant under section 7813 of this title.
