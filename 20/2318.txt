      (A) the amount of the trade readjustment allowance that the worker would have been eligible to receive for any week under sections 2291 to 2294 of this title if the worker had not accepted the full-time employment and had not made the election described in paragraph (1)(C), or
      (B) the excess of–
        (i) an amount equal to 80 percent of the average weekly wage of the worker in the adversely affected employment, over

      (B) The total amount of supplemental wage allowances that may be paid to any worker under any demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the period covered by the certification applicable to such worker shall not exceed an amount that is equal to the excess of–
        (i) the amount of the limitation imposed under section 2293(a)(1) of this title with respect to such worker for such period, over
        (ii) the amount of the trade readjustment allowances paid under sections 2291 to 2294 of this title to such worker for such period.
