  (d) National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment
    (1) Findings
       The Congress finds as follows:
      (A) The current achievement levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.
      (B) During the last 20 years, relatively little changed in how students were taught. Despite much research suggesting better alternatives, classrooms continue to be dominated by textbooks, teacher lectures, short-answer activity sheets, and unequal patterns of student attention.
      (C) Despite progress in narrowing the gaps, the differences in performance between Caucasian students and their minority counterparts remain unacceptably large. While progress has been made in reducing the gender gap in mathematics, such gap still remains at higher levels of problem solving. Too little progress has been made in reducing gender performance gaps favoring males in science and females in writing.
    (2) Purpose
       The purpose of the National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment is to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve student achievement in core content areas and the integration of such areas.

          (XII) developing, identifying, or evaluating new educational assessments, including performance-based and portfolio assessments which demonstrate skill and a command of knowledge; and
          (XIII) other topics relevant to the purposes of the Institute; and
        (ii) may reflect recommendations made by the National Education Goals Panel.
  (e) National Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students
    (1) Findings
       The Congress finds as follows:
      (A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace. Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today“s workplace. Student performance in many inner city neighborhoods grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate in 4 years. In 1992, the average National Assessment of Educational Progress reading score of Caucasian 17 year-olds was approximately 25 points higher than that of African-American 17 year-olds and 20 points higher than that of Hispanic 17 year-olds.
      (B) Rural schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the poor and at-risk students of the United States and yet often lack the means to address effectively the needs of these children. Intensive efforts should be made to overcome the problems of geographic isolation, declining population, inadequate financial resources and other impediments to the educational success of children residing in rural areas.
      (C) By the year 2000, an estimated 3,400,000 school age children with limited-English proficiency will be entering the school system. The Federal Government should develop effective policies and programs to address the educational needs of this growing population of children who are at increased risk of educational failure.
      (D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty. The numbers of disadvantaged children will substantially increase by the year 2020, when the number of impoverished children alone will be 16,500,000, a 33 percent increase over the 12,400,000 children in poverty in 1987.
      (E) American Indian and Alaska Native students have high dropout, illiteracy and poverty rates, and experience cultural, linguistic, social and geographic isolation. The estimated 400,000 Indian and Alaska Native student population from over 500 Indian and Alaska Native tribes, is small and scattered throughout remote reservations and villages in 32 States, and in off-reservation rural and urban communities where Indians constitute but a small percentage of public school student bodies. To meaningfully address the special educational needs of this historically under-served population, the existing research and development system should be opened to Indian and Alaska Native people to identify needs and design ways to address such needs.
      (F) Minority scholars as well as institutions and groups that have been historically committed to the improvement of the education of at-risk students need to be more fully mobilized in the effort to develop a new generation of programs, models, practices, and schools capable of responding to the urgent needs of students who are educationally at-risk.
    (2) Purpose
       It shall be the purpose of the Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve educational opportunities for at-risk students. Such program shall–
      (A) undertake research necessary to provide a sound basis from which to identify, develop, evaluate, and assist others to replicate and adapt interventions, programs, and models which promote greater achievement and educational success by at-risk students, such as–
        (i) methods of instruction and educational practices (including community services) which improve the achievement and retention of at-risk students;
        (ii) the quality of educational opportunities afforded at-risk students, particularly the quality of educational opportunities afforded such students in highly concentrated urban areas and sparsely populated rural areas;
        (iii) methods for overcoming the barriers to learning that may impede student achievement;
        (iv) innovative teacher training and professional development methods to help at-risk students meet challenging standards;
        (v) methods to improve the quality of the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students not only in schools funded by the Bureau, but also in public elementary and secondary schools located on or near Indian reservations, including–
          (I) research on mechanisms to facilitate the establishment of tribal departments of education that assume responsibility for all education programs of State educational agencies operating on an Indian reservation and all education programs funded by the Bureau on an Indian reservation;
          (II) research on the development of culturally appropriate curriculum for American Indian and Alaska Native students, including American Indian and Alaska Native culture, language, geography, history and social studies, and graduation requirements related to such curriculum;
          (III) research on methods for recruiting, training and retraining qualified teachers from American Indian and Alaska Native communities, including research to promote flexibility in the criteria for certification of such teachers;
          (IV) research on techniques for improving the educational achievement of American Indian and Alaska Native students, including methodologies to reduce dropout rates and increase graduation by such students; and
          (V) research concerning the performance by American Indian and Alaska Native students of limited-English proficiency on standardized achievement tests, and related factors;
        (vi) means by which parents and community resources and institutions (including cultural institutions) can be utilized to support and improve the achievement of at-risk students;
        (vii) the training of teachers and other educational professionals and paraprofessionals to work more effectively with at-risk students;
        (viii) the most effective uses of technology in the education of at-risk students;
        (ix) programs designed to promote gender equity in schools that serve at-risk students;
        (x) improving the ability of classroom teachers and schools to assist new and diverse populations of students in successfully assimilating into the classroom environment;
        (xi) methods of assessing the achievement of students which are sensitive to cultural differences, provide multiple methods of assessing student learning, support student acquisition of higher order capabilities, and enable identification of the effects of inequalities in the resources available to support the learning of children throughout the United States; and
        (xii) other topics relevant to the purpose of the Institute; and
      (B) maximize the participation of those schools and institutions of higher education that serve the greatest number of at-risk students in inner city and rural areas, and on Indian reservations, including model collaborative programs between schools and school systems, institutions of higher education, cultural institutions, and community organizations.
    (3) Consultation with Indian and Alaska Native educators
       All research and development activities supported by the Institute which relate to the education of Indian and Alaska Native students shall be developed in close consultation with Indian and Alaska Native researchers and educators, Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, tribal departments of education, and others with expertise in the needs of Indian and Native Alaska students.
  (f) National Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education
    (1) Findings
       The Congress finds as follows:
      (A) Despite efforts to expand and improve preschool programs, many children still reach school age unprepared to benefit from formal education programs.
      (B) Early intervention for disadvantaged children from birth to age five has been shown to be a highly cost-effective strategy for reducing later expenditures on a wide variety of health, developmental, and educational problems that often interfere with learning. Long-term studies of the benefits of preschool education have a demonstrated return on investment ranging from three to six dollars for every one dollar spent.
      (C) The Federal Government should play a central role in providing research-based information on early childhood education models which enhance children“s development and ultimately their success in school.
    (2) Purpose
       The purpose of the National Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education is to carry out a comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve early childhood development and education. Such program shall undertake research necessary to provide a sound basis from which to identify, develop, evaluate, and assist others to replicate methods and approaches that promise to improve early childhood development and education, such as–
      (A) social and educational development of infants, toddlers, and preschool children;
      (B) the role of parents and the community in promoting the successful social and educational development of children from birth to age five;
      (C) topics relating to children“s readiness to learn, such as prenatal care, nutrition, and health services;
      (D) family literacy and parental involvement in student learning;
      (E) methods for integrating learning in settings other than the classroom, particularly within families and communities;
      (F) practices and approaches which sustain the benefits of effective preschool and child care programs;
      (G) effective learning methods and curriculum for early childhood learning, including access to current materials in libraries;
      (H) the importance of family literacy and parental involvement in student learning;
      (I) effective teaching and learning methods, and curriculum;
      (J) instruction that considers the cultural environment of children;
      (K) access to current materials in libraries;
      (L) the impact that outside influences have on learning, including television, and drug and alcohol abuse;
      (M) the structure and environment of early childhood education and child care settings which lead to improved social and educational development;
      (N) training and preparation of teachers and other professional and paraprofessional preschool and child care workers;
      (O) the use of technology, including methods to help parents instruct their children; and
      (P) other topics relevant to the purpose of the Institute.
    (3) Certain requirements
       In carrying out the activities of the Institute, the Assistant Secretary shall ensure that the Institute“s research and development program provides information that can be utilized in improving the major Federal early childhood education programs.
  (g) National Institute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policy-Making, and Management
    (1) Findings
       The Congress finds as follows:
      (A) Many elementary and secondary schools in the United States–
        (i) are structured according to models that are ineffective and rely on notions of management and governance that may be outdated or insufficient for the challenges of the next century; and
        (ii) are unsuccessful in equipping all students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed as citizens and in the working world.
      (B) New approaches are needed in the governance and management of elementary and secondary education within the United States at the State, local, school building and classroom level.
      (C) Not enough is known about the effects of various systems of school governance and management on student achievement to provide sound guidance to policymakers as such policymakers pursue school restructuring and reform.
      (D) A concentrated Federal effort is needed to support research, development, demonstration, and evaluation of approaches to school governance, finance and management which promise to improve education equity and excellence throughout the United States.
    (2) Purpose
       It shall be the purpose of the National Institute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policy-Making, and Management to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve student achievement through school restructuring and reform. Such program shall undertake research necessary to provide a sound basis from which to identify, develop and evaluate approaches in elementary and secondary school governance, finance, policy-making, and management at the State, local, tribal, school building and classroom level which promise to improve educational equity and excellence, such as–
      (A) open enrollment programs, public school choice, magnet schools and other systems through which parents may select the public schools and educational programs in which their children are enrolled;
      (B) innovative school design, including lengthening the school day and the school year, reducing class size and building professional development into the weekly school schedule and, as appropriate, conducting such further research as may be recommended or suggested by the report issued by the National Education Commission on Time and Learning pursuant to section 102 of the Education Council Act of 1991 (20 U.S.C. 1221–1 note);
      (C) effective approaches to organizing learning;
      (D) effective ways of grouping students for learning so that a student is not labeled or stigmatized in ways that may impede such student“s achievement;
      (E) effective approaches to organizing, structuring, and financing vocational education;
      (F) the provision of financial and other rewards and incentives to schools and educators based on performance to improve student achievement;
      (G) the use of regulatory flexibility on the State or school district level to promote innovation and school restructuring;
      (H) policy decisions at all levels and the impact of such decisions on school achievement and other student outcomes;
      (I) the effective use of dollars for classroom construction;
      (J) expanding the role of teachers in policymaking and administration at the school and school district-wide level;
      (K) disparity in school financing among States, school districts, schools, and schools funded by the Bureau;
      (L) the use of technology in areas such as assisting in school-based management or ameliorating the effects of disparity in school financing among States, school districts, and schools funded by the Bureau;
      (M) the involvement of parents and families in the management and governance of schools and the education of their children;
      (N) effective approaches to increasing the representation of women and minorities among leadership and management positions in education;
      (O) approaches to systemic reforms involving the coordination of multiple policies of each level of government to promote higher levels of student achievement;
      (P) approaches to coordinated services for children;
      (Q) teacher certification at the State and tribal levels;
      (R) school-based management, shared decisionmaking and other innovative school structures, and State and local reforms and educational policies, which show promise for improving student achievement;
      (S) policies related to school-to-work transitions and preparing non-college-bound students; and
      (T) other topics relevant to the mission of the Institute.
  (h) National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning
    (1) Findings
       The Congress finds as follows:
      (A) The American system of postsecondary education is foremost in the world in such system“s achievement of both academic excellence and equity in access, but maintaining that preeminence requires renewed efforts to strengthen the quality of postsecondary education. Disappointing student performance on achievement tests and licensure examinations, declining rates of postsecondary education persistence and completion among minorities, and other troubling trends in the quality of postsecondary education should be addressed by the United States as part of its overall drive to improve American education.
      (B) The need to improve our economic productivity of the United States to meet the competitive challenges of a new, international economy, coupled with high levels of mobility in the United States labor market and demographic changes in the workforce, now demands more and higher quality programs of learning and training in the American workplace.
      (C) The more than 1,000,000 men and women incarcerated in the prisons and jails in the United States are among the most severely educationally disadvantaged in the United States, with high rates of functional illiteracy and extremely low levels of educational attainment. Since an estimated 90 percent of these individuals are expected to be released by the end of the decade, the United States must act to assure that our correctional system has the means to equip these Americans with the knowledge and skills they will need to participate productively in our society.
      (D) The development of a ””Nation of Students““ capable of and committed to the pursuit of formal and informal lifelong learning and literacy is essential to sustain both national and individual economic success and to provide a nurturing environment in which all children and youth can learn and achieve. Historically the most effective community resource for lifelong learning, the public library system of the United States, should expand and restructure its delivery of services to take full advantage of the potential of new information technologies to meet the needs of learning communities.
    (2) Purpose
       The purpose of the National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning is to promote greater coordination of Federal research and development on issues related to adult learning and to carry out a program of research and development in adult learning to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve libraries, postsecondary education, literacy, and lifelong learning throughout the United States.
