  (a) Nonsubstitution
     Funds provided under section 1473 of this title may not be used to satisfy a financial commitment for services which would have been paid for from another public or private source but for the enactment of this subchapter, except that whenever considered necessary to prevent a delay in the receipt of appropriate early intervention services by the infant or toddler or family in a timely fashion, funds provided under section 1473 of this title may be used to pay the provider of services pending reimbursement from the agency which has ultimate responsibility for the payment.
  (b) Reduction of other benefits
     Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to permit the State to reduce medical or other assistance available or to alter eligibility under title V of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] (relating to maternal and child health) or title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] (relating to medicaid for infants or toddlers with disabilities) within the State.
