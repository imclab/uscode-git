  (a) Federal share
     The Federal share of expenditures to carry out a State plan shall be paid from a State“s allotment available for grants to that State. The Federal share shall be–
    (1) 90 percent of the cost of carrying out the State“s programs for fiscal year 1988;
    (2) 85 percent of such cost for fiscal year 1990;
    (3) 80 percent of such cost for fiscal year 1991; and
    (4) 75 percent of such cost for fiscal year 1992 and for each fiscal year thereafter,
       except that with respect to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau, the Federal share of such cost shall be 100 percent.
  (b) Maintenance of effort
    (1) No payment may be made to any State from its allotment for any fiscal year unless the Secretary finds that the fiscal effort per student or the amount available for expenditure by such State for adult education from non-Federal sources for the second preceding fiscal year was not less than such fiscal effort per student or such amount available for expenditure for such purposes from such sources during the third preceding fiscal year.
    (2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for 1 fiscal year only, upon making a determination that such waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the ability of the applicant to meet such requirements, such as a natural disaster or an unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.
  (c) Federal responsibility
     Within 1 year after July 25, 1991, the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate experts, educators, and administrators, shall develop indicators of program quality that may be used by State and local programs receiving assistance under this chapter as models by which to judge the success of such programs, including success in recruitment and retention of students and improvement in the literacy skills of students. Such indicators shall take into account different conditions under which programs operate and shall be modified as better means of assessing program quality are developed.
