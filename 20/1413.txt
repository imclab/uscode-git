      (B) Exception
         Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to–

        (ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;
        (iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child–
          (I) has left the jurisdiction of the agency;
          (II) has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide a free appropriate public education to the child has terminated; or

      (B) Charter school exception
         A State educational agency may not require a charter school that is a local educational agency to jointly establish its eligibility under subparagraph (A) unless it is explicitly permitted to do so under the State“s charter school statute.
