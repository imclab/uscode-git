   The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation require such marks, brands, and stamps or devices to be placed on any bulk container (including a pipeline) used for holding, storing, transferring or conveying imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors as he deems necessary and proper in the administration of the Federal laws applicable to such imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors and may specify those marks, brands, and stamps or devices which the importer or owner shall place or have placed on such containers. Any such container of imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors withdrawn from customs custody purporting to contain imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors found without having thereon any mark, brand, stamp, or device the Secretary of the Treasury may require, shall be with its contents, forfeited to the United States of America.
