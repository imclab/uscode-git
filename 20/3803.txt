  (a) Agreements regarding tariff barriers
    (1) In general
       Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President–
      (A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries before–
        (i) June 1, 2005; or
        (ii) June 1, 2007, if trade authorities procedures are extended under subsection (c) of this section; and
      (B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), proclaim–
        (i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
        (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or
        (iii) such additional duties,
       as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
       The President shall notify the Congress of the President“s intention to enter into an agreement under this subsection.
    (2) Limitations
       No proclamation may be made under paragraph (1) that–
      (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on August 6, 2002) to a rate of duty which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on August 6, 2002;
      (B) reduces the rate of duty below that applicable under the Uruguay Round Agreements, on any import sensitive agricultural product; or
      (C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applied on August 6, 2002.
    (3) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging
      (A) Aggregate reduction
         Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if–
        (i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed under paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article; and
        (ii) a reduction equal to the amount applicable under clause (i) had taken effect at 1-year intervals after the effective date of such first reduction.
      (B) Exemption from staging
         No staging is required under subparagraph (A) with respect to a duty reduction that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that is not produced in the United States. The United States International Trade Commission shall advise the President of the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.
    (4) Rounding
       If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (3), the President may round an annual reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of–
      (A) the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
      (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
    (5) Other limitations
       A rate of duty reduction that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction is included within an implementing bill provided for under section 3805 of this title and that bill is enacted into law.
    (6) Other tariff modifications
       Notwithstanding paragraphs (1)(B), (2)(A), (2)(C), and (3) through (5), and subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act [19 U.S.C. 3524], the President may proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX, as defined in section 2(5) of that Act [19 U.S.C. 3501(5)], if the United States agrees to such modification or staged rate reduction in a negotiation for the reciprocal elimination or harmonization of duties under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.
    (7) Authority under Uruguay Round Agreements Act not affected
       Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority provided to the President under section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).
  (b) Agreements regarding tariff and nontariff barriers
    (1) In general
      (A) Whenever the President determines that–
        (i) one or more existing duties or any other import restriction of any foreign country or the United States or any other barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy, or
        (ii) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect,

      (B) The President may enter into a trade agreement under subparagraph (A) with foreign countries providing for–
