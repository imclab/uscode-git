      (C) has failed to meet the criteria established by the State through the State“s transitional procedure under section 6311(b)(7)(B) of this title for two consecutive years.

      (B) Before identifying a school for school improvement under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide the school with an opportunity to review the school-level data, including assessment data, on which such identification is based. If the school believes that such identification for school improvement is in error for statistical or other substantive reasons, such school may provide evidence to the local educational agency to support such belief.
      (C) During the first year immediately following such identification, the school shall implement such school“s plan or revised plan.
    (3) Professional development

        (i) devoting to such activities, over two consecutive years, an amount equivalent to at least 10 percent of the funds received by the school under this part during one fiscal year; or
        (ii) otherwise demonstrating that such school is effectively carrying out professional development activities.

    (4) Technical assistance
      (A) For each school identified under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide technical or other assistance as the school develops and implements such school“s plan or revised plan, such as a joint plan between the local educational agency and school that addresses specific elements of student performance problems and that specifies school and local educational agency responsibilities under the plan, and waivers or modifications of requirements of local educational agency policy or regulation that impede the ability of the school to educate students.
      (B) Such technical assistance may be provided directly by the local educational agency, through mechanisms authorized under section 6318 of this title, or with the local educational agency“s approval, by an institution of higher education, a private nonprofit organization, an educational service agency, a comprehensive regional assistance center under part A of subchapter XIII of this chapter, or other entities with experience in helping schools improve achievement.
    (5) Corrective action
      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), after providing technical assistance pursuant to paragraph (4) and taking other remediation measures, the local educational agency may take corrective action at any time against a school that has been identified under paragraph (1), but, during the third year following identification under paragraph (1), shall take such action against any school that still fails to make adequate progress.
      (B)        (i) Corrective actions are those, consistent with State and local law, determined and made public and disseminated by the local educational agency, which may include–
          (I) withholding funds;
          (II) interagency collaborative agreements between the school and other public agencies to provide health, counseling, and other social services needed to remove barriers to learning;
          (III) revoking authority for a school to operate a schoolwide program;
          (IV) decreasing decisionmaking authority at the school level;

        (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), corrective actions taken pursuant to this part shall not include the actions described in subclause (I), (III), (IV), (VI), or (VII) of clause (i) until the State has developed assessments that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of section 6311(b)(3) of this title.
      (C) Prior to implementing any corrective action, the local educational agency may refrain from such corrective action for one additional year to the extent that the failure to make progress can be attributed to extenuating circumstances as determined by the local educational agency.
      (D) A school that is no longer operating its schoolwide program due to a corrective action may not resume operation of such a program until the local educational agency determines that the school has adequately reformed its schoolwide program plan to enable the school to make adequate progress toward meeting the State“s challenging student performance standards.
    (6) State educational agency responsibilities
       The State educational agency shall–
      (A) make technical assistance under section 6318 of this title available to the schools farthest from meeting the State“s challenging student performance standards, if requested by the school or local educational agency; and

  (d) State review and local educational agency improvement
    (1) In general
       A State educational agency shall–
      (A) annually review the progress of each local educational agency receiving funds under this part to determine whether schools receiving assistance under this part are making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title toward meeting the State“s student performance standards; and
      (B) publicize and disseminate to local educational agencies, teachers and other staff, parents, students, and the community the results of the State review, including statistically sound disaggregated results, as required by section 6311(b)(3)(I) of this title.

       In the case of a local educational agency that for three consecutive years has met or exceeded the State“s definition of adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title, the State may make institutional and individual rewards of the kinds described for individual schools in paragraph (2) of section 6318(c) of this title.
    (3) Identification
      (A) A State educational agency shall identify for improvement any local educational agency that–
        (i) for two consecutive years, is not making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title in schools served under this part toward meeting the State“s student performance standards, except that schools served by the local educational agency that are operating targeted assistance programs may be reviewed on the basis of the progress of only those students served under this part; or
        (ii) has failed to meet the criteria established by the State through such State“s transitional procedure under section 6311(b)(7)(B) of this title for two consecutive years.
      (B) Before identifying a local educational agency for improvement under paragraph (1), the State educational agency shall provide the local educational agency with an opportunity to review the school-level data, including assessment data, on which such identification is based. If the local educational agency believes that such identification for improvement is in error due to statistical or other substantive reasons, such local educational agency may provide evidence to the State educational agency to support such belief.
    (4) Local educational agency revisions
      (A) Each local educational agency identified under paragraph (3) shall, in consultation with schools, parents, and educational experts, revise its local educational agency plan under section 6312 of this title in ways that have the greatest likelihood of improving the performance of schools served by the local educational agency under this part in meeting the State“s student performance standards.
      (B) Such revision shall include determining why the local educational agency“s plan failed to bring about increased achievement.
    (5) State educational agency responsibility
      (A) For each local educational agency identified under paragraph (3), the State educational agency shall–
        (i) provide technical or other assistance, if requested, as authorized under section 6318 of this title, to better enable the local educational agency to–
