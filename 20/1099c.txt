  (a) General requirement
     For purposes of qualifying institutions of higher education for participation in programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, the Secretary shall determine the legal authority to operate within a State, the accreditation status, and the administrative capability and financial responsibility of an institution of higher education in accordance with the requirements of this section.
  (b) Single application form
     The Secretary shall prepare and prescribe a single application form which–
    (1) requires sufficient information and documentation to determine that the requirements of eligibility, accreditation, and capability of the institution of higher education are met;
    (2) requires a specific description of the relationship between a main campus of an institution of higher education and all of its branches, including a description of the student aid processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is performed at its branches;
    (3) requires a description of third party servicers of an institution of higher education, together with a copy of any contract with the institution of higher education and a financial aid service provider or loan servicer; and
    (4) requires such other information as the Secretary determines will ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 with respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability and financial responsibility.
  (c) Financial responsibility standards
    (1) The Secretary shall determine whether an institution has the financial responsibility required by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 on the basis of whether the institution is able–
      (A) to provide the services described in its official publications and statements;
      (B) to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with the requirements of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42; and
      (C) to meet all of its financial obligations, including (but not limited to) refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an institution fails to meet criteria prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits then the institution shall provide the Secretary with satisfactory evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with paragraph (3). Such criteria shall take into account any differences in generally accepted accounting principles, and the financial statements required thereunder, that are applicable to for profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary shall take into account an institution“s total financial circumstances in making a determination of its ability to meet the standards herein required.
    (3) The Secretary shall determine an institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding the institution“s failure to meet the criteria under paragraphs (1) and (2), if–
      (A) such institution submits to the Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, which third-party financial guarantees shall equal not less than one-half of the annual potential liabilities of such institution to the Secretary for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, including loan obligations discharged pursuant to section 1087 of this title, and to students for refunds of institutional charges, including funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42;
      (B) such institution has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of a State, or its equivalent;
      (C) such institution establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial statement audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the institution has sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of the institution, including the ability to meet all of its financial obligations (including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary); or
      (D) such institution has met standards of financial responsibility, prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, that indicate a level of financial strength not less than those required in paragraph (2).
    (4) If an institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree fails to meet the ratio of current assets to current liabilities imposed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall waive that particular requirement for that institution if the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that–
      (A) there is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services;
      (B) it is current in its payment of all current liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and
      (C) it has substantial equity in school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio requirement.
    (5) The determination as to whether an institution has met the standards of financial responsibility provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3)(C) shall be based on an audited and certified financial statement of the institution. Such audit shall be conducted by a qualified independent organization or person in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Such statement shall be submitted to the Secretary at the time such institution is considered for certification or recertification under this section. If the institution is permitted to be certified (provisionally or otherwise) and such audit does not establish compliance with paragraph (2), the Secretary may require that additional audits be submitted.
    (6)      (A) The Secretary shall establish requirements for the maintenance by an institution of higher education of sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds.
      (B) The Secretary shall provide for a process under which the Secretary shall exempt an institution of higher education from the requirements described in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that the institution–
        (i) is located in a State that has a tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution meets the requirements of subparagraph (A);
        (ii) contributes to the fund; and
        (iii) otherwise has legal authority to operate within the State.
  (d) Administrative capacity standard
     The Secretary is authorized–
    (1) to establish procedures and requirements relating to the administrative capacities of institutions of higher education, including–
      (A) consideration of past performance of institutions or persons in control of such institutions with respect to student aid programs; and
      (B) maintenance of records;
    (2) to establish such other reasonable procedures as the Secretary determines will contribute to ensuring that the institution of higher education will comply with administrative capability required by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.
  (e) Financial guarantees from owners
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary to protect the financial interest of the United States, require–

      (B) the assumption of personal liability, by one or more individuals who exercise substantial control over such institution, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2), for financial losses to the Federal Government, student assistance recipients, and other program participants for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, and civil and criminal monetary penalties authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.
    (2)      (A) The Secretary may determine that an individual exercises substantial control over one or more institutions participating in a program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 if the Secretary determines that–

        (ii) the individual, either alone or together with other individuals, represents, under a voting trust, power of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement, one or more persons who have, individually or in combination with the other persons represented or the individual representing them, a substantial ownership interest in the institution; or
        (iii) the individual is a member of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or other executive officer of the institution or of an entity that holds a substantial ownership interest in the institution.
      (B) The Secretary may determine that an entity exercises substantial control over one or more institutions participating in a program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 if the Secretary determines that the entity directly or indirectly holds a substantial ownership interest in the institution.
    (3) For purposes of this subsection, an ownership interest is defined as a share of the legal or beneficial ownership or control of, or a right to share in the proceeds of the operation of, an institution or institution“s parent corporation.

      (B) has not had, during its 2 most recent audits of the institutions conduct of programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, an audit finding that resulted in the institution being required to repay an amount greater than 5 percent of the funds the institution received from programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for any year;
      (C) meets and has met, for the preceding 5 years, the financial responsibility standards under subsection (c) of this section; and
      (D) has not been cited during the preceding 5 years for failure to submit audits required under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 in a timely fashion.
    (5) For purposes of section 1094(c)(1)(G) of this title, this section shall also apply to individuals or organizations that contract with an institution to administer any aspect of an institution“s student assistance program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.
