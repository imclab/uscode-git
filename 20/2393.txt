   The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor shall establish and maintain a program to monitor imports of articles into the United States which will reflect changes in the volume of such imports, the relation of such imports to changes in domestic production, changes in employment within domestic industries producing articles like or directly competitive with such imports, and the extent to which such changes in production and employment are concentrated in specific geographic regions of the United States. A summary of the information gathered under this section shall be published regularly and provided to the Adjustment Assistance Coordinating Committee, the International Trade Commission, and to the Congress.
