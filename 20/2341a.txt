Each such eligible institution or consortium shall receive an amount that bears the same relationship to the amount of funds available under such section as the number of Pell Grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs enrolled in programs meeting the requirements of section 2342 of this title offered by such institution or consortium in the preceding fiscal year bears to the number of such recipients enrolled in such programs within the State in such year.
    (2) In order for a consortium of eligible institutions described in paragraph (1) to receive assistance pursuant to such paragraph such consortium shall operate joint projects that–
      (A) provide services to all postsecondary institutions participating in the consortium; and
      (B) are of sufficient size, scope and quality as to be effective.
  (b) Waiver for more equitable distribution
     The Secretary may waive the application of subsection (a) of this section in the case of any State that submits to the Secretary an application for such a waiver that–
    (1) demonstrates that the formula described in subsection (a) of this section does not result in a distribution of funds to the institutions or consortia within the State that have the highest numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals and that an alternative formula would result in such a distribution; and
    (2) includes a proposal for an alternative formula that may include criteria relating to the number of individuals attending institutions or consortia within the State who–
      (A) receive need-based postsecondary financial aid provided from public funds;
      (B) are members of families participating in the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.];
      (C) are enrolled in postsecondary educational institutions that–
        (i) are funded by the State;

      (D) are enrolled in programs serving economically disadvantaged adults;
      (E) are participants in programs assisted under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.]; or
      (F) are recipients of Pell Grants.
  (c) Minimum grant amount
    (1) No grant provided to any institution or consortium under this section shall be for an amount that is less than $50,000.
    (2) Any amounts which are not allocated by reason of paragraph (1) shall be redistributed to eligible institutions or consortia in accordance with the provisions of this section.
