        (iii) children living in sparsely populated areas.
      (B) The Secretary shall review criteria submitted by a State educational agency for adjusting allocations under paragraph (1) and shall approve such criteria only if the Secretary determines that such criteria are reasonably calculated to produce an adjusted allocation that reflects the relative needs within the State“s local educational agencies based on the factors set forth in subparagraph (A).
