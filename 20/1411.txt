  (a) Formula for determining maximum State entitlement
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (5), the maximum amount of the grant for which a State is entitled under this section for any fiscal year is–
      (A) the sum of–
        (i) the number of children with disabilities in the State, aged 6 through 21, who are receiving special education and related services, as determined under paragraph (3); and
        (ii) if the State is eligible for a grant under section 1419 of this title, the number of such children in the State, aged 3 through 5; multiplied by
      (B) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the United States.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, the term ””State““ means each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (3) The number of children with disabilities receiving special education and related services in any fiscal year shall be equal to number of such children receiving special education and related services on December 1 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term ””average per pupil expenditure““, in the United States, means the aggregate current expenditures, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the computation is made (or, if satisfactory data for such year are not available at the time of computation, then during the most recent preceding fiscal year for which satisfactory data are available) of all local educational agencies in the United States (which, for purposes of this subsection, means the fifty States and the District of Columbia), as the case may be, plus any direct expenditures by the State for operation of such agencies (without regard to the source of funds from which either of such expenditures are made), divided by the aggregate number of children in average daily attendance to whom such agencies provided free public education during such preceding year.
    (5)      (A) In determining the allotment of each State under paragraph (1), the Secretary may not count–
        (i) children with disabilities aged three to seventeen, inclusive, in such State under paragraph (1)(A) to the extent the number of such children is greater than 12 percent of the number of all children aged three to seventeen, inclusive, in such State, or the combined percentage of such children counted by the Secretary for the purpose of making fiscal year 1994 allocations under this section and under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994), whichever is greater, if the State serves all children with disabilities aged three to five, inclusive, in the State pursuant to State law or practice or the order of any court, and
        (ii) children with disabilities aged five to seventeen, inclusive, in such State under paragraph (1)(A) to the extent the number of such children is greater than 12 percent of the number of all children aged five to seventeen, inclusive, in such State, or the combined percentage of such children counted by the Secretary for the purpose of making fiscal year 1994 allocations under this section and under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994), whichever is greater, if the State does not serve all children with disabilities aged three to five, inclusive, in the State pursuant to State law or practice or the order of any court.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the number of children aged three to seventeen, inclusive, in any State shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to the Secretary.
  (b) Minimum amount of funds to States for fiscal years 1995 to 1999
    (1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (g) of this section, no State shall receive an amount under this section for any of the fiscal years 1995 through 1999 that is less than the sum of the amount such State received for fiscal year 1994 under–
      (A) this section; and
      (B) subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on October 20, 1994) for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21.
    (2) If, for fiscal year 1998 or 1999, the number of children determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any State is less than the total number of children with disabilities, aged 3 through 21, counted for that State“s fiscal year 1994 grants under this section and under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on October 20, 1994), then the amount determined under paragraph (1) for that State shall be reduced by the same percentage by which the number of those children so declined.
    (3)      (A) If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all States are eligible to receive under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allocations to such States for such year.
      (B) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, allocations that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis as such allocations were reduced.
  (c) Distribution and use of grant funds by States for fiscal years ending September 30, 1979, and thereafter

    (2)      (A) From the funds that any State may use under paragraph (1)(A) for any fiscal year, the State–
        (i) may use 5 percent of the funds received under this section or $450,000, whichever is greater, for administrative costs related to carrying out sections 1412 and 1413 of this title; and
        (ii) shall use the remainder–
          (I) to provide support services and direct services, subject to subparagraph (B), in accordance with priorities established under section 1412(3) of this title; and
          (II) for the administrative costs of monitoring and complaint investigation, but only to the extent that such costs exceed the costs of administration incurred during fiscal year 1985.
      (B) The amount expended by any State from the funds available to such State under paragraph (1)(A) in any fiscal year for the provision of support services or for the provision of direct services shall be matched on a program basis by such State, from funds other than Federal funds, for the provision of support services or for the provision of direct services for the fiscal year involved.
    (3) The provisions of section 1413(a)(9) of this title shall not apply with respect to amounts available for use by any State under paragraph (2).
    (4)      (A) No funds shall be distributed by any State under this subsection in any fiscal year to any local educational agency or intermediate educational unit in such State if–

        (ii) such local educational agency or intermediate educational unit has not submitted an application for such funds which meets the requirements of section 1414 of this title.
      (B) Whenever the provisions of subparagraph (A) apply, the State involved shall use such funds to assure the provision of a free appropriate education to children with disabilities residing in the area served by such local educational agency or such intermediate educational unit. The provisions of paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to the use of such funds.
  (d) Allocation of funds within States to local educational agencies and intermediate educational units
    (1) From the total amount of funds available for any fiscal year under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, the State shall provide to each local educational agency or intermediate educational unit an amount that bears the same ratio to such total amount as the number of children, aged 3 through 21, determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for such agency or unit bears to the total number of such children determined for all such agencies and units that apply for such funds.
    (2)      (A) To the extent necessary, the State–
        (i) shall use funds available under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section to ensure that each State agency that received funds for fiscal year 1994 under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) receives, from the sum of such funds and funds provided under paragraph (1), an amount equal to–
          (I) the number of children, aged 6 through 21, determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for such agency; multiplied by
          (II) the per-child amount provided under such subpart for fiscal year 1994; and
        (ii) may use such funds to ensure that each local educational agency that received for fiscal year 1994 under such subpart for children who had transferred from a State-owned, State-operated, or State-supported school or program assisted under such subpart receives, from the sum of such funds and funds provided under paragraph (1), an amount for each such child, aged 3 through 21, determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for such agency, equal to the per-child amount the agency received under such subpart for fiscal year 1994.
      (B) For the purpose of subparagraph (A), the number of children determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any State agency or local educational agency shall not exceed the number of children aged 3 through 21 for whom such agency received funds under such subpart for such fiscal year.

The Secretary of the Interior shall be responsible for meeting all of the requirements of this subchapter for these children, in accordance with paragraph (3). The amount of such payment for any fiscal year shall be 1 percent of the aggregate amounts available for all States under this section for that fiscal year.
    (2) With respect to all other children aged 3–21, inclusive, on reservations, the State educational agency shall be responsible for ensuring that all of the requirements of this subchapter are implemented.
    (3) The Secretary of the Interior may receive an allotment under paragraph (1) only after submitting to the Secretary of Education an application that–

The Secretary of Education may require any additional information from the Secretary of the Interior.
      (F) The Secretary of the Interior shall offer and, on request, provide technical assistance (especially in the areas of child find, diagnosis, and referral) to State and local educational agencies (where appropriate, intermediate educational units), and tribes and tribal organizations.

In developing such a plan, the Secretary of the Interior shall consult with all interested and involved parties. It shall be based upon the needs of the children and the system best suited for meeting those needs, and may involve the establishment of cooperative agreements between the BIA, other Federal agencies, and other entities. Such plan shall also be distributed upon request to States, State and local educational agencies, and other agencies providing services to infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities, to tribes, and to other interested parties.
    (6) To meet the requirements of sections 1413(a)(12) of this title, the Secretary of the Interior shall establish, within 6 months of October 7, 1991, under the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an advisory board composed of individuals involved in or concerned with the education and provision of services to Indian infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities, including Indians with disabilities, Indian parents or guardians of such children, teachers, service providers, State and local educational officials, representatives of tribes or tribal organizations, representatives from State Interagency Coordinating Councils in States having reservations, and other members representing the various divisions and entities of the BIA.

      (B) If additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.
      (C) Any State that receives any such additional funds shall distribute such funds in accordance with this section, except that any State that has used funds available under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section for the purposes described in subsection (d)(2) of this section may–
        (i) deduct, from the amount that the State would otherwise be required to make available to local educational agencies and intermediate educational units, the same amount of such additional funds as the State so used; and
        (ii) use such funds in accordance with subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section.
    (2)      (A) In any fiscal year for which payments have been reduced and additional funds have not been made available under paragraph (1) to pay in full the amounts for which all States are eligible under this section, each State educational agency shall fix dates by which each local educational agency or intermediate educational unit shall report to the State agency the amount of funds available to such agency under this section that such agency estimates such agency will expend.
      (B) The State educational agency shall, in accordance with this section, reallocate any funds that the State educational agency determines will not be used during the period of availability by local educational agencies and intermediate educational units, and by any such agency or unit to which such funds would be available if such agency or unit applied for such funds under this subchapter, to those local educational agencies and intermediate educational units that the State educational agency determines will need, and be able to use, additional funds to carry out approved programs.
  (h) Authorization of appropriations
     For grants under subsection (a) of this section there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary.
