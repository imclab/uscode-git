          (II) the sum of–
            (aa) the amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and
            (bb) that amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase in the funds appropriated from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or
          (III) the sum of–
            (aa) the amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and
            (bb) that amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase in the amount appropriated from the preceding fiscal year.
        (iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), no State“s allocation under this paragraph shall exceed the sum of–
          (I) the amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and

      (C) If the amount available for allocations under this paragraph is insufficient to pay those allocations in full, those allocations shall be ratably reduced, subject to subparagraph (B)(i).
    (4) Decrease in funds
       If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (1) is less than the amount allocated to the States under this section for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations shall be calculated as follows:
      (A) If the amount available for allocations is greater than the amount allocated to the States for the base year, each State shall be allocated the sum of–
        (i) the amount it received for the base year; and
        (ii) an amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as the increase the State received for the preceding fiscal year over the base year bears to the total of all such increases for all States.
      (B)        (i) If the amount available for allocations is equal to or less than the amount allocated to the States for the base year, each State shall be allocated the amount it received for the base year.
