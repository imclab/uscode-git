   Nothing in this chapter or any other Federal law shall be construed to prohibit any institution of higher education from requiring a student who is a foreign national (and not admitted to permanent residence in the United States) to guarantee the future payment of tuition and fees to such institution by (1) making advance payment of such tuition and fees, (2) making deposits in an escrow account administered by such institution for such payments, or (3) obtaining a bond or other insurance that such payments will be made.
