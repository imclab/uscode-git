Such notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under section 1083(b) of this title if such disclosure has not been previously made.
          (D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.
          (E) Loans on which the interest rate is converted in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subsection.
      (j) Lesser rates permitted
         Nothing in this section or section 1078–3 of this title shall be construed to prohibit a lender from charging a borrower interest at a rate less than the rate which is applicable under this part.
