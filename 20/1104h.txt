  (b) Suspension of eligibility
     Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to the State agency administering a State program approved under this subpart, finds–
    (1) that the State program has been so changed that it no longer complies with the provisions of this subpart, or
    (2) that in the administration of the program there is a failure to comply substantially with any such provisions,
       the Secretary shall notify such State agency that the State will not be regarded as eligible to participate in the program under this subpart until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply.
  (c) Court review
    (1) In general

The Secretary shall forthwith certify and file in the court the transcript of the proceedings and the record on which the action was based.
    (2) Findings
       The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify any previous action, and shall certify to the court the transcript and record of further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.
