  (f) Preference to corporations with employee stock ownership plan; requisite features of plan
    (1) When considering whether to guarantee a loan to a corporation which is otherwise qualified for the purposes of subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall give preference to a corporation which agrees with respect to such loan to fulfill the following requirements–
      (A) 25 percent of the principal amount of the loan is paid by the lender to a qualified trust established under an employee stock ownership plan established and maintained by the recipient corporation, by a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, or by several corporations including the recipient corporation.
      (B) the employee stock ownership plan meets the requirements of this subsection, and
      (C) the agreement among the recipient corporation, the lender, and the qualified trust relating to the loan meets the requirements of this section.

      (A) the amount of the loan paid under paragraph (1)(A) to the qualified trust will be used to purchase qualified employer securities,
      (B) the qualified trust will repay to the lender the amount of such loan, together with the interest thereon, out of amounts contributed to the trust by the recipient corporation, and
      (C) from time to time, as the qualified trust repays such amount, the trust will allocate qualified employer securities among the individual accounts of participants and their beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4).
    (3) The agreement among the recipient corporation, the lender, and the qualified trust does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless–
      (A) it is unconditionally enforceable by any party against the others, jointly and severally,
      (B) it provides that the liability of the qualified trust to repay loan amounts paid to the qualified trust may not, at any time, exceed an amount equal to the amount of contributions required under paragraph (2)(B) which are actually received by such trust,
      (C) it provides that amounts received by the recipient corporation from the qualified trust for qualified employer securities purchased for the purpose of this subsection will be used exclusively by the recipient corporation for those purposes for which it may use that portion of the loan paid directly to it by the lender,
      (D) it provides that the recipient corporation may not reduce the amount of its equity capital during the one year period beginning on the date on which the qualified trust purchases qualified employer securities for purposes of this subsection, and
      (E) it provides that the recipient corporation will make contributions to the qualified trust of not less than such amounts as are necessary for such trust to meet its obligation to make repayments of principal and interest on the amount of the loan received by the trust without regard to whether such contributions are deductible by the corporation under section 404 of title 26 and with out regard to any other amounts the recipient corporation is obligated under law to contribute to or under the employee stock ownership plan.
    (4) At the close of each plan year, an employee stock ownership plan shall allocate to the accounts of participating employees that portion of the qualified employer securities the cost of which bears substantially the same ratio to the cost of all the qualified employer securities purchased under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection as the amount of the loan principal and interest repaid by the qualified trust during that year bears to the total amount of the loan principal and interest payable by such trust during the term of such loan. Qualified employer securities allocated to the individual account of a participant during one plan year must bear substantially the same proportion to the amount of all such securities allocated to all participants in the plan as the amount of compensation paid to such participant bears to the total amount of compensation paid to all such participants during that year.
