       During any review under this subsection initiated 2 years or 4 years after the publication of an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title, the administering authority, if requested, shall determine whether antidumping duties have been absorbed by a foreign producer or exporter subject to the order if the subject merchandise is sold in the United States through an importer who is affiliated with such foreign producer or exporter. The administering authority shall notify the Commission of its findings regarding such duty absorption for the Commission to consider in conducting a review under subsection (c) of this section.
  (b) Reviews based on changed circumstances
    (1) In general
       Whenever the administering authority or the Commission receives information concerning, or a request from an interested party for a review of–
      (A) a final affirmative determination that resulted in an antidumping duty order under this subtitle or a finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or in a countervailing duty order under this subtitle or section 1303 \1\ of this title,
      (B) a suspension agreement accepted under section 1671c or 1673c of this title, or
      (C) a final affirmative determination resulting from an investigation continued pursuant to section 1671c(g) or 1673c(g) of this title,
       which shows changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review of such determination or agreement, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall conduct a review of the determination or agreement after publishing notice of the review in the Federal Register.
    (2) Commission review
       In conducting a review under this subsection, the Commission shall–

      (B) in the case of a determination made pursuant to section 1671c(h)(2) or 1673c(h)(2) of this title, determine whether the suspension agreement continues to eliminate completely the injurious effects of imports of the subject merchandise, and
      (C) in the case of an affirmative determination resulting from an investigation continued under section 1671c(g) or 1673c(g) of this title, determine whether termination of the suspended investigation is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury.
    (3) Burden of persuasion
       During a review conducted by the Commission under this subsection–
      (A) the party seeking revocation of an order or finding described in paragraph (1)(A) shall have the burden of persuasion with respect to whether there are changed circumstances sufficient to warrant such revocation, and

    (4) Limitation on period for review
       In the absence of good cause shown–
      (A) the Commission may not review a determination made under section 1671d(b) or 1673d(b) of this title, or an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title, and
      (B) the administering authority may not review a determination made under section 1671d(a) or 1673d(a) of this title, or an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title,
       less than 24 months after the date of publication of notice of that determination or suspension.
  (c) Five-year review
    (1) In general
       Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section and except in the case of a transition order defined in paragraph (6), 5 years after the date of publication of–
      (A) a countervailing duty order (other than a countervailing duty order to which subparagraph (B) applies or which was issued without an affirmative determination of injury by the Commission under section 1303 \1\ of this title), an antidumping duty order, or a notice of suspension of an investigation, described in subsection (a)(1) of this section,
      (B) a notice of injury determination under section 1675b of this title with respect to a countervailing duty order, or
      (C) a determination under this section to continue an order or suspension agreement,
       the administering authority and the Commission shall conduct a review to determine, in accordance with section 1675a of this title, whether revocation of the countervailing or antidumping duty order or termination of the investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) and of material injury.
    (2) Notice of initiation of review
       Not later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary of the date described in paragraph (1), the administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of a review under this subsection and request that interested parties submit–
      (A) a statement expressing their willingness to participate in the review by providing information requested by the administering authority and the Commission,
      (B) a statement regarding the likely effects of revocation of the order or termination of the suspended investigation, and
      (C) such other information or industry data as the administering authority or the Commission may specify.
    (3) Responses to notice of initiation
      (A) No response
         If no interested party responds to the notice of initiation under this subsection, the administering authority shall issue a final determination, within 90 days after the initiation of a review, revoking the order or terminating the suspended investigation to which such notice relates. For purposes of this paragraph, an interested party means a party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title.
      (B) Inadequate response
         If interested parties provide inadequate responses to a notice of initiation, the administering authority, within 120 days after the initiation of the review, or the Commission, within 150 days after such initiation, may issue, without further investigation, a final determination based on the facts available, in accordance with section 1677e of this title.
    (4) Waiver of participation by certain interested parties
      (A) In general
         An interested party described in section 1677(9)(A) or (B) of this title may elect not to participate in a review conducted by the administering authority under this subsection and to participate only in the review conducted by the Commission under this subsection.
      (B) Effect of waiver
         In a review in which an interested party waives its participation pursuant to this paragraph, the administering authority shall conclude that revocation of the order or termination of the investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) with respect to that interested party.
    (5) Conduct of review
      (A) Time limits for completion of review
         Unless the review has been completed pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) applies, the administering authority shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(b) or (c) of this title within 240 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection. If the administering authority makes a final affirmative determination, the Commission shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(a) of this title within 360 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection.
      (B) Extension of time limit

In a review in which the administering authority extends the time for making a final determination, but the Commission does not extend the time for making a determination, the Commission“s determination shall be made not later than 120 days after the date on which the final determination of the administering authority is published.
      (C) Extraordinarily complicated
         For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may treat a review as extraordinarily complicated if–

        (iv) Revocation and termination
           No transition order may be revoked under this subsection before the date that is 5 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.
      (B) Sequence of transition reviews
         The administering authority, in consultation with the Commission, shall determine such sequence of review of transition orders as it deems appropriate to promote administrative efficiency. To the extent practicable, older orders shall be reviewed first.
      (C) ””Transition order““ defined
         For purposes of this section, the term ””transition order““ means–
        (i) a countervailing duty order under this subtitle or under section 1303 \2\N of this title,
        (ii) an antidumping duty order under this subtitle or a finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or
        (iii) a suspension of an investigation under section 1671c or 1673c of this title,

         For purposes of this subsection, a transition order shall be treated as issued on the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, if such order is based on an investigation conducted by both the administering authority and the Commission.
  (d) Revocation of order or finding; termination of suspended investigation
    (1) In general
       The administering authority may revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, after review under subsection (a) or (b) of this section. The administering authority shall not revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or terminate a suspended investigation on the basis of any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States which are specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.
    (2) Five-year reviews
       In the case of a review conducted under subsection (c) of this section, the administering authority shall revoke a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, unless–
      (A) the administering authority makes a determination that dumping or a countervailable subsidy, as the case may be, would be likely to continue or recur, and
      (B) the Commission makes a determination that material injury would be likely to continue or recur as described in section 1675a(a) of this title.
    (3) Application of revocation or termination
       A determination under this section to revoke an order or finding or terminate a suspended investigation shall apply with respect to unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date determined by the administering authority.
  (e) Hearings
     Whenever the administering authority or the Commission conducts a review under this section, it shall, upon the request of an interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with section 1677c(b) of this title in connection with that review.
  (f) Determination that basis for suspension no longer exists
     If the determination of the Commission under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section is negative, the suspension agreement shall be treated as not accepted, beginning on the date of publication of the Commission“s determination, and the administering authority and the Commission shall proceed, under section 1671c(i) or 1673c(i) of this title, as if the suspension agreement had been violated on that date, except that no duty under any order subsequently issued shall be assessed on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.
  (g) Reviews to implement results of subsidies enforcement proceeding
    (1) Violations of article 8 of the subsidies agreement
       If–
      (A) the administering authority receives notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement,
      (B) the administering authority has reason to believe that merchandise subject to an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, and
      (C) no review pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section is in progress,
       the administering authority shall conduct a review of the order or suspended investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise benefits from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement. If the administering authority determines that the subject merchandise is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program, it shall make appropriate adjustments in the estimated duty to be deposited or appropriate revisions to the terms of the suspension agreement.
    (2) Withdrawal of subsidy or imposition of countermeasures
       If the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that, pursuant to Article 4 or Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement–
      (A)        (i) the United States has imposed countermeasures, and
        (ii) such countermeasures are based on the effects in the United States of imports of merchandise that is the subject of a countervailing duty order, or
      (B) a WTO member country has withdrawn a countervailable subsidy provided with respect to merchandise subject to a countervailing duty order,
       the administering authority shall conduct a review to determine if the amount of the estimated duty to be deposited should be adjusted or the order should be revoked.
    (3) Expedited review
       The administering authority shall conduct reviews under this subsection on an expedited basis, and shall publish the results of such reviews in the Federal Register.
  (h) Correction of ministerial errors
     The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term ””ministerial error““ includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.
