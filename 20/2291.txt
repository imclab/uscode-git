  (a) Trade readjustment allowance conditions
     Payment of a trade readjustment allowance shall be made to an adversely affected worker covered by a certification under subpart A of this part who files an application for such allowance for any week of unemployment which begins more than 60 days after the date on which the petition that resulted in such certification was filed under section 2271 of this title, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such worker“s total or partial separation before his application under this part occurred–
      (A) on or after the date, as specified in the certification under which he is covered, on which total or partial separation began or threatened to begin in the adversely affected employment,
      (B) before the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the determination under section 2273 of this title was made, and
      (C) before the termination date (if any) determined pursuant to section 2273(d) of this title.
    (2) Such worker had, in the 52-week period ending with the week in which such total or partial separation occurred, at least 26 weeks of employment at wages of $30 or more a week in adversely affected employment with a single firm or subdivision of a firm, or, if data with respect to weeks of employment with a firm are not available, equivalent amounts of employment computed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

      (B) has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance, except additional compensation that is funded by a State and is not reimbursed from any Federal funds, to which he was entitled (or would be entitled if he applied therefor); and

          (II) the last day of the 8th week after the week in which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker,
          (III) 45 days after the later of the dates specified in subclause (I) or (II), if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period, or
          (IV) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,

      (C) has received a written statement under subsection (c)(1) of this section after the date described in subparagraph (B).
  (b) Withholding of trade readjustment allowance pending beginning or resumption of participation in training program; period of applicability
    (1) If–
      (A) the Secretary determines that–
        (i) the adversely affected worker–
          (I) has failed to begin participation in the training program the enrollment in which meets the requirement of subsection (a)(5) of this section, or
          (II) has ceased to participate in such training program before completing such training program, and
        (ii) there is no justifiable cause for such failure or cessation, or
      (B) the certification made with respect to such worker under subsection (c)(1) of this section is revoked under subsection (c)(2) of this section,
         no trade readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker under this division for the week in which such failure, cessation, or revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title.
    (2) The provisions of subsection (a)(5) of this section and paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any week of unemployment which begins–

    (1) Issuance of waivers
       The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) of this section if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:
      (A) Recall
         The worker has been notified that the worker will be recalled by the firm from which the separation occurred.
      (B) Marketable skills

        (i) old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) (except for application therefor); or
        (ii) a private pension sponsored by an employer or labor organization.
      (D) Health
         The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.
      (E) Enrollment unavailable
         The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.
      (F) Training not available
         Training approved by the Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in section 2302 of title 20, and employers), no training that is suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable cost, or no training funds are available.
    (2) Duration of waivers
      (A) In general
         A waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.
      (B) Revocation
         The Secretary shall revoke a waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in writing of the revocation.
    (3) Agreements under section 2311
      (A) Issuance by cooperating States
