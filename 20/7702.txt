    (3) Determination of aggregate assessed value
       Such aggregate assessed value of such acquired Federal property shall be determined on the basis of the highest and best use of property adjacent to such acquired Federal property as of the time such value is determined, and provided to the Secretary, by the local official responsible for assessing the value of real property located in the jurisdiction of such local educational agency for the purpose of levying a property tax.
