  (a) In general
     Each State educational agency receiving funds reserved pursuant to section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title shall use such funds–
    (1) first, to conduct a study of teacher education programs within such State, as required under subsection (c) of this section; and
    (2) secondly, for–
      (A) the establishment of State Academies for Teachers under section 1102d of this title;
      (B) the establishment of State Academies for School Leaders under section 1102e of this title; and
      (C) activities directly related to the implementation of the teacher education study required under subsection (c) of this section.
  (b) Special rule
     If a State educational agency can demonstrate that the amount of funds reserved pursuant to section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title is insufficient to establish one State academy, then the State educational agency shall distribute such funds to local educational agencies in accordance with section 1102(b)(2)(A) or 1102(c) of this title to carry out the activities described in section 1102b(b) of this title.
  (c) Teacher education study
    (1) Study required
       Each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall, in consultation with institutions of higher education, local educational agencies, teachers, parents, the State legislature, the State board of education, and business, undertake a study of–
      (A) teacher education programs and State teacher professional development requirements, including programs and requirements intended to train preschool and early childhood education specialists; and
      (B) the State laws and regulations relating to such programs and requirements, including any standards or requirements for certification and licensure,
       in order to determine if such programs and requirements are adequately preparing teachers to effectively educate students.
    (2) Considerations
       Such study shall consider whether such programs or requirements–
      (A) would be improved if teacher education programs were required to coordinate courses with other departments on campus in order to provide prospective teachers with a strong background in their subject matter;
      (B) integrate academic and vocational education instruction;
      (C) give enough flexibility in order to allow experimentation and innovation;
      (D) would be improved if such programs provided preparation for students desiring to become teachers, but who are pursuing a bachelor“s degree in an area of study other than education;
      (E) would be improved if teacher certification required a bachelor“s degree in a subject area and a master“s degree in education; and
      (F) would be improved if institutions of higher education that have developed innovative materials and curricula for inservice training were required to incorporate these improvements into their preservice programs.
    (3) Deadlines
      (A) Such study shall be completed by two years from the end of the first fiscal year in which funding was made available for this part. The results of such study shall be reported to the Secretary. In submitting the report to the Secretary, the State educational agency shall include in the report the most successful practices used to enhance the profession of teaching. The Secretary may disseminate such successful practices in order to assist other States in their efforts to enhance the profession of teaching.
      (B) Except as provided in paragraph (4), beginning in the third fiscal year for which funding under this part is available, State educational agencies shall use all funds provided under section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title which are not allotted for State Academies for Teachers and State Academies for School Leaders–
        (i) to implement the program and policy changes resulting from the findings of such study; and
        (ii) to assist schools and programs of education throughout the State in meeting any new requirements that result from such study.
      (C) The State educational agency shall award grants pursuant to section 1102f(b)(9) of this title to institutions of higher education to implement the programs and policy changes resulting from the findings of such study.
    (4) Waiver
       If a State demonstrates to the Secretary that it has completed a study comparable to the study required by this subsection within the previous 5 years prior to the fiscal year for which funds are first made available under this part, then the Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection. States receiving a waiver shall use funds provided under section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title to implement the program and policy changes resulting from the findings of such study. If the State can demonstrate to the Secretary that such program and policy changes have been implemented, then the State shall use funds provided under section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title to carry out the activities authorized under sections 1102d and 1102e of this title.
