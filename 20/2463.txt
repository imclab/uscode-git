      (A) In general
         Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the President is authorized to designate articles as eligible articles from all beneficiary developing countries for purposes of this subchapter by Executive order or Presidential proclamation after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.

    (2) Rule of origin
      (A) General rule

        (ii) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.
    (3) Regulations

         A country which is no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article by reason of subparagraph (A) may, subject to the considerations set forth in sections 2461 and 2462 of this title, be redesignated a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in subparagraph (A) during the preceding calendar year.
      (D) Least-developed beneficiary developing countries and beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries
         Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any least-developed beneficiary developing country or any beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

      (F) De minimis waivers
        (i) In general
           The President may disregard subparagraph (A)(i)(II) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the applicable amount for such preceding calendar year.

          (II) for each calendar year thereafter, an amount equal to the applicable amount in effect for the preceding calendar year plus $500,000.
  (d) Waiver of competitive need limitation
    (1) In general
       The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) of this section with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary developing country if, before July 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section was made with respect to such eligible article, the President–
      (A) receives the advice of the International Trade Commission under section 1332 of this title on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waiver,
      (B) determines, based on the considerations described in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title and the advice described in subparagraph (A), that such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States, and
      (C) publishes the determination described in subparagraph (B) in the Federal Register.
    (2) Considerations by the President
       In making any determination under paragraph (1), the President shall give great weight to–
      (A) the extent to which the beneficiary developing country has assured the United States that such country will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country, and
      (B) the extent to which such country provides adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.
    (3) Other bases for waiver
       The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) of this section if, before July 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2) of this section was made with respect to a beneficiary developing country, the President determines that–
      (A) there has been a historical preferential trade relationship between the United States and such country,
      (B) there is a treaty or trade agreement in force covering economic relations between such country and the United States, and
      (C) such country does not discriminate against, or impose unjustifiable or unreasonable barriers to, United States commerce,
       and the President publishes that determination in the Federal Register.
    (4) Limitations on waivers
      (A) In general
         The President may not exercise the waiver authority under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which equals or exceeds 30 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year.
      (B) Other waiver limits
         The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which exceeds 15 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year–
        (i) had a per capita gross national product (calculated on the basis of the best available information, including that of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) of $5,000 or more; or
        (ii) had exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of articles that was duty-free under this subchapter that had an aggregate appraised value of more than 10 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during that year.
      (C) Calculation of limitations
         There shall be counted against the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for any calendar year only that value of any eligible article of any country that–
        (i) entered duty-free under this subchapter during such calendar year; and
        (ii) is in excess of the value of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section applied.
    (5) Effective period of waiver
       Any waiver granted under this subsection shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.
  (e) International Trade Commission advice
     Before designating articles as eligible articles under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the President shall publish and furnish the International Trade Commission with lists of articles which may be considered for designation as eligible articles for purposes of this subchapter. The provisions of sections 2151, 2152, 2153, and 2154 of this title shall be complied with as though action under section 2461 of this title and this section were action under section 2133 of this title to carry out a trade agreement entered into under section 2133 of this title.
  (f) Special rule concerning Puerto Rico
     No action under this subchapter may affect any tariff duty imposed by the Legislature of Puerto Rico pursuant to section 1319 of this title on coffee imported into Puerto Rico.
