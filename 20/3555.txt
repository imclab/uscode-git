  (a) Trade in financial services
     The principal negotiating objective of the United States in the extended negotiations on financial services to be conducted under the auspices of the WTO is to seek to secure commitments, from a wide range of commercially important developed and developing countries, to reduce or eliminate barriers to the supply of financial services, including barriers that deny national treatment or market access by restricting the establishment or operation of financial services providers, as the condition for the United States–
    (1) offering commitments to provide national treatment and market access in each of the financial services subsectors, and
    (2) making such commitments on a normal trade relations basis.
  (b) Trade in basic telecommunications services
     The principal negotiating objective of the United States in the extended negotiations on basic telecommunications services to be conducted under the auspices of the WTO is to obtain the opening on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions of foreign markets for basic telecommunications services through facilities-based competition or through the resale of services on existing networks.
  (c) Trade in civil aircraft
    (1) Negotiations

      (B) to obtain the reduction or elimination of specific tariff and nontariff barriers, including through expanded membership in the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft and in the US–EC bilateral agreement for large civil aircraft,
