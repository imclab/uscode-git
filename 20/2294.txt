     Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this part and subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the availability and disqualification provisions of the State law–
    (1) under which an adversely affected worker is entitled to unemployment insurance (whether or not he has filed a claim for such insurance), or

       shall apply to any such worker who files a claim for trade readjustment allowances.

     Any law, regulation, policy, or practice of a cooperating State that allows for a waiver for good cause of any time limitation relating to the administration of the State unemployment insurance law shall, in the administration of the program under this part by the State, apply to any time limitation with respect to an application for a trade readjustment allowance or enrollment in training under this part.
