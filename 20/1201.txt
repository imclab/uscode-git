   It is the purpose of this chapter to assist the States to improve educational opportunities for adults who lack the level of literacy skills requisite to effective citizenship and productive employment, to expand and improve the current system for delivering adult education services including delivery of such services to educationally disadvantaged adults, and to encourage the establishment of adult education programs that willâ€“
  (1) enable these adults to acquire the basic educational skills necessary for literate functioning;
  (2) provide these adults with sufficient basic education to enable them to benefit from job training and retraining programs and obtain and retain productive employment so that they might more fully enjoy the benefits and responsibilities of citizenship; and
  (3) enable adults who so desire to continue their education to at least the level of completion of secondary school.
