     To assist institutions of higher education and higher education building agencies in the construction, reconstruction, or renovation of housing, undergraduate and graduate academic facilities, and other educational facilities for students and faculty, the Secretary may make loans of funds to such institutions for the construction, reconstruction, or renovation of such facilities. No such assistance shall be provided unless–
    (1) the educational institution involved is unable to secure the necessary funds for the construction or purchase from other sources upon terms and conditions equally as favorable as the terms and conditions applicable to loans under this subchapter; and
    (2) the Secretary finds that any such construction will be undertaken in an economical manner, and that any such facilities are not or will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or materials.
  (b) Amount and conditions of loans
     A loan to institutions of higher education or higher education building agency–
    (1) may be in an amount not exceeding the total development cost of the facility, as determined by the Secretary;
    (2) shall be secured in such manner and be repaid within such period, not exceeding 50 years, as may be determined by the Secretary; and
    (3) shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary which shall be not more than the lower of (A) 5.5 percent per annum, or (B) the total of one-quarter of 1 percent per annum added to the rate of interest paid by the Secretary on funds obtained from the Secretary of the Treasury.
  (c) Use of loans for previously made contracts
     Any institution of higher education or higher education building agency which, prior to October 17, 1986, had contracted for housing or other educational facilities may, in connection therewith, receive loans authorized under this part, as the Secretary may determine. No such loan shall be made for any housing or other educational facilities, the construction of which was begun prior to such date, or completed prior to the filing of an application under this part.
  (d) Matching requirement
     The Secretary shall not make a loan under this part unless the institution of higher education or higher education building agency receiving such loan provides from non-Federal sources at least 20 percent of the development cost of the project for which the loan is made.
