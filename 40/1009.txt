  (a) If the Secretary, in consultation with the National Capital Memorial Commission, determines that a site where commemorative works may be displayed on a temporary basis is necessary in order to aid in the preservation of the limited amount of open space available to residents of, and visitors to, the Nationâ€œs Capital, a site may be designated on lands administered by the Secretary in the District of Columbia. A designation may not be made under the preceding sentence unless, at least one hundred and twenty days before the designation, the Secretary, in consultation with the National Capital Memorial Commission, prepares and submits to the Congress a plan for the site. The plan shall include specifications for the location, construction, and administration of the site, and criteria for displaying commemorative works at the site.
  (b) Any commemorative work displayed at the site shall be installed, maintained, and removed at the sole expense and risk of the person authorized to display the commemorative works. Such person shall agree to indemnify the United States for any liability arising from the display of the commemorative work under this section.
