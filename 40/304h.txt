   In the event that any property seized by any agency is or has been forfeited to the United States otherwise than by court decree, it may, in the event that the property is not ordered by competent authority to be returned to any claimant, and in lieu of being disposed of as otherwise provided by law (including advertisement for sale, and sale), be retained by such agency and devoted to official use only. If such agency shall not desire so to retain such property, the head thereof shall forthwith notify the Administrator to that effect, and such property shallâ€“
  (a) in the event that it is not ordered by competent authority to be returned to any claimant, and in lieu of being disposed of as otherwise provided by law (including advertisement for sale, and sale), be delivered by such agency, upon order of the Administrator given within a reasonable time, to any other agency which requests and in the judgment of the Administrator should be given the property, or
  (b) upon order of the Administrator given within a reasonable time, be disposed of as otherwise provided by law.
