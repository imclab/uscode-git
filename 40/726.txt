   On and after the effective date of the regulations prescribed under section 721 of this title, no executive department, independent establishment, agency, wholly owned corporation, officer, or employee shall expend any money, or incur any obligation, for insurance, or for the payment of premiums on insurance, against loss, destruction, or damage in the shipment of valuables except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury may give such authorization if he shall find that the risk of loss, destruction, or damage in such shipment cannot be adequately guarded against by the facilities of the United States or that the circumstances are such that adequate replacement cannot be provided under this chapter.
