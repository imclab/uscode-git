   When the Administrator of General Services considers it desirable, the Administrator may assign to a State or a territory or possession of the United States any part of the authority of the Federal Government to administer criminal laws and health and safety laws with respect to land or an interest in land under the control of the Administrator and located in the State, territory, or possession. Assignment of authority under this section may be accomplished by filing with the chief executive officer of the State, territory, or possession a notice of assignment to take effect on acceptance, or in another manner as may be prescribed by the laws of the State, territory, or possession in which the land or interest is located.
