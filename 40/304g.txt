   In the event that any property is or has been voluntarily abandoned to any agency in such manner as to vest title thereto in the United States, it may be retained by such agency and devoted to official use only. If such agency shall not desire so to retain such property, the head thereof shall forthwith notify the Administrator to that effect, and the Administrator shall, within a reasonable timeâ€“
  (a) order such agency to deliver the property to any other agency which requests and in his judgment should be given the property, or
  (b) order disposal of the property as otherwise provided by law.
