Such other codes shall include, but not be limited to, electrical codes, fire and life safety codes, and plumbing codes, as determined appropriate by the Administrator.

      (B) upon request, submit such plans in a timely manner to such officials for review by such officials for a reasonable period of time not exceeding 30 days; and
      (C) permit inspection by such officials during construction or alteration of the building, in accordance with the customary schedule of inspections for construction or alteration of buildings in the locality, if such officials provide to the Administrator or the head of the Federal agency, as the case may be–

     Appropriate officials of a State or a political subdivision of a State may make recommendations to the Administrator or the head of the Federal agency authorized to construct or alter a building concerning measures necessary to meet the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such officials may also make recommendations to the Administrator or the head of the Federal agency concerning measures which should be taken in the construction or alteration of the building to take into account local conditions. The Administrator or the head of the Federal agency shall give due consideration to any such recommendations.
  (e) Effect of noncompliance

     This section shall not apply with respect to any building if the Administrator or the head of the Federal agency authorized to construct or alter the building determines that the application of this section to the building would adversely affect national security. A determination under this subsection shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review.
