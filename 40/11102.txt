   It is the sense of Congress that, during the five-year period beginning with 1996, executive agencies should achieve each year through improvements in information resources management by the agencyâ€“
  (1) at least a five percent decrease in the cost (in constant fiscal year 1996 dollars) incurred by the agency in operating and maintaining information technology; and
  (2) a five percent increase in the efficiency of the agency operations.
