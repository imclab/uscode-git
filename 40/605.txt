  (a) Replacement of existing buildings; demolition, exchange or sale
     Whenever the Administrator deems it to be in the best interest of the United States to construct a new public building to take the place of an existing public building, he is authorized to demolish the existing building and to use the site on which it is located for the site of the proposed public building, or, if in his judgment it is more advantageous to construct such public building on a different site in the same city, he is authorized to exchange such building and site, or such site, for another site, or to sell such building and site in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.].
  (b) Sale or exchange of sites
     Whenever the Administrator determines that a site acquired for the construction of a public building is not suitable for that purpose, he is authorized to exchange such site for another, or to sell it in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.].
  (c) Committee approval as condition precedent to use of land as site for building
     Nothing in this section shall be deemed to permit the Administrator to use any land as a site for a public building if such project has not been approved in accordance with section 606 of this title.
