   The acquisition by the United States of any real property in connection with any low-cost housing, or slum-clearance project constructed with funds allotted to the Administrator of General Services pursuant to any law, shall not be held to deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil and criminal jurisdiction in and over such property, or to impair the civil rights under the local law of the tenants or inhabitants on such property; and insofar as any such jurisdiction has been taken away from any such State or subdivision, or any such rights have been impaired, jurisdiction over any such property is ceded back to such State or subdivision.
