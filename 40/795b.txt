  (1) will result in a savings to other consumers of electric energy sold by such non-Federal person without increasing the cost incurred by any agency for electric energy, or
  (2) will result in a cost savings to such agency of electric energy without increasing costs to other consumers of electric energy,
     taking into account the remaining useful life of any facility available to such agency to generate electric energy for such agency and the cost of maintaining such facility on a standby basis.
