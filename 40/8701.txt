  (a) T4FindingsK.–Congress finds that–
    (1) the location of the seat of government in the District of Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and Virginia;

    (3) the distribution of federal installations throughout the region has been and will continue to be a major influence in determining the extent and character of development;
    (4) there is needed a central planning agency for the National Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of the many different agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments so that those activities may conform with general objectives;
    (5) there is an increasing mutuality of interest and responsibility between the various levels of government that calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both federal and local development in the interest of order and economy;
    (6) there are developmental problems of an interstate character, the planning of which requires collaboration between federal, state, and local governments in the interest of equity and constructive action; and
    (7) the instrumentalities and procedures provided in this chapter will aid in providing Congress with information and advice requisite to legislation.
