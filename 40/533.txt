  (a) To the extent practicable, prior to a commitment to acquire any real property situated in an urban area, the Administrator shall notify the unit of general local government exercising zoning and land-use jurisdiction over the land proposed to be purchased of his intent to acquire such land and the proposed use of the property. In the event that the Administrator determines that such advance notice would have an adverse impact on the proposed purchase, he shall, upon conclusion of the acquisition, immediately notify such local government of the acquisition and the proposed use of the property.
  (b) In the acquisition or change of use of any real property situated in an urban area as a site for public building, the Administrator shall, to the extent he determines practicableâ€“
    (1) consider all objections made to any such acquisition or change of use by such unit of government upon the ground that the proposed acquisition or change of use conflicts or would conflict with the zoning regulations or planning objectives of such unit; and
    (2) comply with and conform to such regulations of the unit of general local government having jurisdiction with respect to the area within which such property is situated and the planning and development objectives of such local government.
