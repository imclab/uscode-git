  (a) Disposition of receipts
     All proceeds under this subchapter from any transfer of excess property to a Federal agency for its use, or from any sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus property, shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of this section.
  (b) Deposit of proceeds from sales; use; report
     Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all the proceeds of such dispositions of surplus real and related personal property made by the Administrator of General Services shall be set aside in a separate fund in the Treasury. Not more than an amount to be determined quarterly by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may be obligated from such fund by the Administrator to pay the direct expenses incurred for the utilization of excess property and the disposal of surplus property under this Act for fees of appraisers, auctioneers, and realty brokers, for costs of environmental and historic preservation services, and for advertising and surveying. Such payments from this fund may be used either to pay such expenses directly or to reimburse the fund or appropriation initially bearing such expenses. Fees paid to appraisers, auctioneers, and brokers shall be in accordance with the scale of fees customarily paid for such services in similar commercial transactions, and in no event shall more than 12 per centum of the proceeds of all dispositions within each fiscal year of surplus real and related personal property be paid out of such proceeds under this authorization to meet direct expenses incurred in connection with such dispositions.

  (e) Sale proceeds offset against price or cost of contractor“s work
     Where any contract entered into by an executive agency or any subcontract under such contract authorizes the proceeds of any sale of property in the custody of the contractor or subcontractor to be credited to the price or cost of the work covered by such contract or subcontract, the proceeds of any such sale shall be credited in accordance with the contract or subcontract.
  (f) Acceptance of property in lieu of cash
     Any executive agency entitled to receive cash under any contract covering the lease, sale or other disposition of surplus property may in its discretion accept, in lieu of cash, any property determined by the President to be strategic or critical material at the prevailing market price thereof at the time the cash payment or payments became or become due.

    (1) If the Secretary of a military department determines that real property, and improvements thereon, under the control of that department (other than property at a military installation designated for closure or realignment) is excess to the needs of that department, the Secretary of Defense shall provide that the property be made available for transfer without reimbursement to the other military departments within the Department of Defense. If the property is not transferred to another military department, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall request the Administrator to transfer or dispose of such property in accordance with the provisions of this Act, section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)), or other applicable law.
    (2) The Administrator shall deposit any proceeds (less expenses of transferring or disposing of the property as provided in subsection (b) of this section) in a special account in the Treasury of the United States.
