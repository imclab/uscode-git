  (b) Specific requirement
     At a minimum, the regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall preclude a contractor from using subcontracts for more than 65 percent of the cost of the contract or the cost of any individual task or delivery order (not including overhead and profit), unless the Secretary determines that such requirement is not feasible or practicable.
  (c) Covered contracts
     This section applies to any cost-reimbursement type contract or task or delivery order in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined by section 403 of title 41) entered into by the Department to facilitate response to or recovery from a natural disaster or act of terrorism or other man-made disaster.
