The Commissioner, after the completion of the process under subsection (c), may publish in the Federal Register a list of participants who have been suspended or expelled from C–TPAT pursuant to this subsection, and may make such list available to C–TPAT participants.
  (c) Right of appeal
    (1) In general

    (2) Appeals of other decisions
