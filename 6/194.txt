  (d) Omitted
  (e) Multiyear interoperability grants
    (1) Multiyear commitments
       In awarding grants to any State, region, local government, or Indian tribe for the purposes of enhancing interoperable communications capabilities for emergency response providers, the Secretary may commit to obligate Federal assistance beyond the current fiscal year, subject to the limitations and restrictions in this subsection.
    (2) Restrictions
      (A) Time limit
         No multiyear interoperability commitment may exceed 3 years in duration.
      (B) Amount of committed funds
         The total amount of assistance the Secretary has committed to obligate for any future fiscal year under paragraph (1) may not exceed $150,000,000.
    (3) Letters of intent
      (A) Issuance
         Pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue a letter of intent to an applicant committing to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Federal Government“s share of the project“s cost, for an interoperability communications project (including interest costs and costs of formulating the project).
      (B) Schedule
         A letter of intent under this paragraph shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the applicant for the Federal Government“s share of the project“s costs, as amounts become available, if the applicant, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project before receiving amounts under a grant issued by the Secretary.

  (g) Definitions
     In this section:
    (1) Interoperable communications
       The term ””interoperable communications““ means the ability of emergency response providers and relevant Federal, State, and local government agencies to communicate with each other as necessary, through a dedicated public safety network utilizing information technology systems and radio communications systems, and to exchange voice, data, and video with one another on demand, in real time, as necessary.
    (2) Emergency response providers
       The term ””emergency response providers““ has the meaning that term has under section 101 of this title.
  (h) Omitted
    (i) Sense of Congress regarding interoperable communications
      (1) Finding
         The Congress finds that–
        (A) many first responders working in the same jurisdiction or in different jurisdictions cannot effectively and efficiently communicate with one another; and
        (B) their inability to do so threatens the public“s safety and may result in unnecessary loss of lives and property.
      (2) Sense of Congress
         It is the sense of Congress that interoperable emergency communications systems and radios should continue to be deployed as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community, and that upgraded and new digital communications systems and new digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus standards for interoperability.
