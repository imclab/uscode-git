  (a) One hundred percent screening of cargo containers and 100 percent scanning of high-risk containers
    (1) Screening of cargo containers
       The Secretary shall ensure that 100 percent of the cargo containers originating outside the United States and unloaded at a United States seaport undergo a screening to identify high-risk containers.
    (2) Scanning of high-risk containers
       The Secretary shall ensure that 100 percent of the containers that have been identified as high-risk under paragraph (1), or through other means, are scanned or searched before such containers leave a United States seaport facility.
  (b) Full-scale implementation
     The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and foreign partners, as appropriate, shall ensure integrated scanning systems are fully deployed to scan, using nonintrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment, all containers entering the United States before such containers arrive in the United States as soon as possible, but not before the Secretary determines that the integrated scanning systemâ€“
    (1) meets the requirements set forth in section 981(c) of this title;
    (2) has a sufficiently low false alarm rate for use in the supply chain;
    (3) is capable of being deployed and operated at ports overseas;
    (4) is capable of integrating, as necessary, with existing systems;
    (5) does not significantly impact trade capacity and flow of cargo at foreign or United States ports; and
    (6) provides an automated notification of questionable or high-risk cargo as a trigger for further inspection by appropriately trained personnel.
  (c) Report
     Not later than 6 months after the submission of a report under section 981(d) of this title, and every 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees describing the status of full-scale deployment under subsection (b) and the cost of deploying the system at each foreign port at which the integrated scanning systems are deployed.
