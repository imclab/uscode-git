   It is the sense of Congress thatâ€“
  (1) the missions of the Bureau of Border Security and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services are equally important and, accordingly, they each should be adequately funded; and
  (2) the functions transferred under this part should not, after such transfers take effect, operate at levels below those in effect prior to November 25, 2002.
