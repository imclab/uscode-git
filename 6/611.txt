Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133, 5170 et seq., and 5191 et seq.)) that include or substantially affect parts or all of more than 1 State coordinate, as appropriate, across State boundaries, including, where appropriate, through the use of regional working groups and requirements for regional plans.
  (b) Planning committees
    (1) In general
       Any State or high-risk urban area receiving a grant under section 604 or 605 of this title shall establish a planning committee to assist in preparation and revision of the State, regional, or local homeland security plan and to assist in determining effective funding priorities for grants under sections 604 and 605 of this title.
    (2) Composition
      (A) In general
         The planning committee shall include representatives of significant stakeholders, including–

      (B) Geographic representation
         The members of the planning committee shall be a representative group of individuals from the counties, cities, towns, and Indian tribes within the State or high-risk urban area, including, as appropriate, representatives of rural, high-population, and high-threat jurisdictions.
    (3) Existing planning committees
       Nothing in this subsection may be construed to require that any State or high-risk urban area create a planning committee if that State or high-risk urban area has established and uses a multijurisdictional planning committee or commission that meets the requirements of this subsection.
  (c) Interagency coordination
    (1) In general
       Not later than 12 months after August 3, 2007, the Secretary (acting through the Administrator), the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the heads of other agencies providing assistance to State, local, and tribal governments for preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, shall jointly–
      (A) compile a comprehensive list of Federal grant programs for State, local, and tribal governments for preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters;
      (B) compile the planning, reporting, application, and other requirements and guidance for the grant programs described in subparagraph (A);
      (C) develop recommendations, as appropriate, to–
        (i) eliminate redundant and duplicative requirements for State, local, and tribal governments, including onerous application and ongoing reporting requirements;
        (ii) ensure accountability of the programs to the intended purposes of such programs;
        (iii) coordinate allocation of grant funds to avoid duplicative or inconsistent purchases by the recipients;
        (iv) make the programs more accessible and user friendly to applicants; and

    (2) Scope of task
       Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the elimination, or the alteration of the purposes, as delineated by statute, regulation, or guidance, of any grant program that exists on August 3, 2007, nor authorize the review or preparation of proposals on the elimination, or the alteration of such purposes, of any such grant program.
  (d) Sense of Congress
     It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that the Nation is most effectively able to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters–
    (1) the Department should administer a coherent and coordinated system of both terrorism-focused and all-hazards grants;
    (2) there should be a continuing and appropriate balance between funding for terrorism-focused and all-hazards preparedness, as reflected in the authorizations of appropriations for grants under the amendments made by titles I and II, as applicable, of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; and
    (3) with respect to terrorism-focused grants, it is necessary to ensure both that the target capabilities of the highest risk areas are achieved quickly and that basic levels of preparedness, as measured by the attainment of target capabilities, are achieved nationwide.
