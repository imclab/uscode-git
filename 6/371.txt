    (6) other matters the disclosure of which would, in the Secretary“s judgment, constitute a serious threat to national security.
  (b) Prohibition of certain investigations
     With respect to the information described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may prohibit the Inspector General from carrying out or completing any audit or investigation, or from issuing any subpoena, after such Inspector General has decided to initiate, carry out, or complete such audit or investigation or to issue such subpoena, if the Secretary determines that such prohibition is necessary to prevent the disclosure of any information described in subsection (a) of this section, to preserve the national security, or to prevent a significant impairment to the interests of the United States.
