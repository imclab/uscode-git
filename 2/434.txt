      (C) Targeting to relevant electorate
         For purposes of this paragraph, a communication which refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office is ””targeted to the relevant electorate““ if the communication can be received by 50,000 or more persons–
        (i) in the district the candidate seeks to represent, in the case of a candidate for Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress; or
