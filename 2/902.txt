  (a) Fiscal years 1992–1998 enforcement
     The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation (enacted after November 5, 1990) affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit in any fiscal year covered by this Act will trigger an offsetting sequestration.
  (b) Sequestration; look-back
     Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase in that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any prior sequestration as provided by paragraph (2)). OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding–
    (1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) of this section applicable to those fiscal years, other than any amounts included in such estimates resulting from–
      (A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on November 5, 1990, and
      (B) emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e) of this section; and
    (2) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to those fiscal years resulting from the prior year“s sequestration under this section or section 903 of this title, if any (except for any amounts sequestered as a result of a net deficit increase in the fiscal year immediately preceding the prior fiscal year), as published in OMB“s end-of-session sequestration report for that prior year.
  (c) Eliminating a deficit increase
    (1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:
      (A) First
         All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a) of this title shall be made.
      (B) Second
         If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.
      (C) Third
        (i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by paragraph (1); except that the medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.
        (ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.
    (2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.
  (d) OMB estimates
     As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates. Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
  (e) Emergency legislation
     If, for any fiscal year from 1991 through 1998, a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years through 1995 \1\N resulting from that provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d) of this section. This subsection shall not apply to direct spending provisions to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.
