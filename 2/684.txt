     Whenever the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of any department or agency of the United States, or any officer or employee of the United States proposes to defer any budget authority provided for a specific purpose or project, the President shall transmit to the House of Representatives and the Senate a special message specifying–
    (1) the amount of the budget authority proposed to be deferred;
    (2) any account, department, or establishment of the Government to which such budget authority is available for obligation, and the specific projects or governmental functions involved;
    (3) the period of time during which the budget authority is proposed to be deferred;
    (4) the reasons for the proposed deferral, including any legal authority invoked to justify the proposed deferral;
    (5) to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed deferral; and

       A special message may include one or more proposed deferrals of budget authority. A deferral may not be proposed for any period of time extending beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the special message proposing the deferral is transmitted to the House and the Senate.

    (2) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations; or
    (3) as specifically provided by law.
       No officer or employee of the United States may defer any budget authority for any other purpose.
  (c) Exception
     The provisions of this section do not apply to any budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that is to be reserved as set forth in a special message required to be transmitted under section 683 of this title.
