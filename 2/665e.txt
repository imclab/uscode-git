  (e) Continuing disability review adjustment
    (1) In general
      (A) For fiscal year 1996, upon the enactment of the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, the Chairmen of the Committees on the Budget of the Senate and House of Representatives shall make the adjustments referred to in subparagraph (C) to reflect $15,000,000 in additional new budget authority and $60,000,000 in additional outlays for continuing disability reviews (as defined in section 401(g)(1)(A) of title 42).
      (B) When the Committee on Appropriations reports an appropriations measure for fiscal year 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002 that specifies an amount for continuing disability reviews under the heading ””Limitation on Administrative Expenses““ for the Social Security Administration, or when a conference committee submits a conference report thereon, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate or House of Representatives (whichever is appropriate) shall make the adjustments referred to in subparagraph (C) to reflect the additional new budget authority for continuing disability reviews provided in that measure or conference report and the additional outlays flowing from such amounts for continuing disability reviews. If the adjustments referred to in the preceding sentence are made for an appropriations measure that is not enacted into law, then the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall, as soon as practicable, reverse those adjustments. The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall submit any adjustments made under this subparagraph to the House of Representatives and have such adjustments published in the Congressional Record.
      (C) The adjustments referred to in this subparagraph consist of adjustments to–
        (i) the discretionary spending limits for that fiscal year as set forth in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget;
        (ii) the allocations to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives for that fiscal year under sections 633(a) and 665a(a) of this title; and
        (iii) the appropriate budgetary aggregates for that fiscal year in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.
      (D) The adjustments under this paragraph for any fiscal year shall not exceed the levels set forth in section 251(b)(2)(H) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(H)] for that fiscal year. The adjusted discretionary spending limits, allocations, and aggregates under this paragraph shall be considered the appropriate limits, allocations, and aggregates for purposes of congressional enforcement of this Act and concurrent budget resolutions under this Act.
    (2) Reporting revised suballocations
       Following the adjustments made under paragraph (1), the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives may report appropriately revised suballocations pursuant to sections 633(b) and 665a(b) of this title to carry out this subsection.
    (3) Definitions
       As used in this section, the terms ””continuing disability reviews““, ””additional new budget authority““, and ””additional outlays““ shall have the same meanings as provided in section 251(b)(2)(H)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(H)(ii)].
