    (2) a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate, including the costs and benefits to State, local, and tribal governments or the private sector, as well as the effect of the Federal mandate on health, safety, and the natural environment and such an assessment shall include–
      (A) an analysis of the extent to which such costs to State, local, and tribal governments may be paid with Federal financial assistance (or otherwise paid for by the Federal Government); and
      (B) the extent to which there are available Federal resources to carry out the intergovernmental mandate;
    (3) estimates by the agency, if and to the extent that the agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible, of–

    (4) estimates by the agency of the effect on the national economy, such as the effect on productivity, economic growth, full employment, creation of productive jobs, and international competitiveness of United States goods and services, if and to the extent that the agency in its sole discretion determines that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible and that such effect is relevant and material; and
    (5)      (A) a description of the extent of the agency“s prior consultation with elected representatives (under section 1534 of this title) of the affected State, local, and tribal governments;
      (B) a summary of the comments and concerns that were presented by State, local, or tribal governments either orally or in writing to the agency; and
