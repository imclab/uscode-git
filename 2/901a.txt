  (a) Sequestration
     Within 15 days after Congress adjourns to end a session, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate any budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section.
  (b) Eliminating a budgetary excess
    (1) In general
       Except as provided by paragraph (2), appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall be reduced by a uniform percentage necessary to eliminate any amount by which estimated outlays in the budget year from the Fund exceed the following levels of outlays:
      (A) For fiscal year 1995, $703,000,000.
      (B) For fiscal year 1996, $2,334,000,000.
      (C) For fiscal year 1997, $3,936,000,000.
      (D) For fiscal year 1998, $4,904,000,000.
       For fiscal year 1999, the comparable level for budgetary purposes shall be deemed to be $5,639,000,000. For fiscal year 2000, the comparable level for budgetary purposes shall be deemed to be $6,225,000,000.
    (2) Special outlay allowance
       If estimated outlays from the Fund for a fiscal year exceed the level specified in paragraph (1) for that year, that level shall be increased by the lesser of that excess or 0.5 percent of that level.
  (c) Look-back
     If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts under this section), the level set forth in subsection (b) of this section for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that excess.
  (d) Within-session sequestration
     If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for the budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts under this section), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that excess following the procedures set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
  (e) Part-year appropriations and OMB estimates
     Paragraphs (4) and (7) of section 901(a) of this title shall apply to appropriations from, and sequestration of amounts appropriated from, the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund under this section in the same manner as those paragraphs apply to discretionary appropriations and sequestrations under that section.
