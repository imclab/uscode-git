   From and after October 1, 1980, payments in advance for subscriptions or other charges for bibliographical data, publications, materials in any other form, and services may be made by the Librarian of Congress whenever he determines it to be more prompt, efficient, or economical to do so in the interest of carrying out required Library programs.
