  (a) Allocation of totals
    (1) For the House of Representatives, the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget shall include an estimated allocation, based upon such concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference report, of the appropriate levels of total budget outlays, total new budget authority, and total entitlement authority among each committee of the House of Representatives which has jurisdiction over laws, bills and resolutions providing such new budget authority,\1\N or such entitlement authority. The allocation shall, for each committee, divide new budget authority,\1\ and entitlement authority between amounts provided or required by law on the date of such conference report (mandatory or uncontrollable amounts), and amounts not so provided or required (discretionary or controllable amounts), and shall make the same division for estimated outlays that would result from such new budget authority.
    (2) For the Senate, the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget shall include an estimated allocation, based upon such concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference report, of the appropriate levels of social security outlays for the fiscal year of the resolution and for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years, total budget outlays and total new budget authority among each committee of the Senate which has jurisdiction over bills and resolutions providing such new budget authority.
  (b) Reports by committees
     As soon as practicable after a concurrent resolution on the budget is agreed to–
    (1) the Committee on Appropriations of each House shall, after consulting with the Committee on Appropriations of the other House, (A) subdivide among its subcommittees the allocation of budget outlays and new budget authority allocated to it in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on such concurrent resolution, and (B) further subdivide the amount with respect to each such subcommittee between controllable amounts and all other amounts; and
    (2) every other committee of the House and Senate to which an allocation was made in such joint explanatory statement shall, after consulting with the committee or committees of the other House to which all or part of its allocation was made, (A) subdivide such allocation among its subcommittees or among programs over which it has jurisdiction, and (B) further subdivide the amount with respect to each subcommittee or program between controllable amounts and all other amounts.
       Each such committee shall promptly report to its House the subdivisions made by it pursuant to this subsection.
  (c) Point of order
     It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, providing–
    (1) new budget authority for a fiscal year; or
    (2) new spending authority as described in section 651(c)(2) of this title for a fiscal year;
       within the jurisdiction of any committee which has received an appropriate allocation of such authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year, unless and until such committee makes the allocation or subdivisions required by subsection (b) of this section, in connection with the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year.
  (d) Subsequent concurrent resolutions
     In the case of a concurrent resolution on the budget referred to in section 635 of this title, the allocations under subsection (a) of this section and the subdivisions under subsection (b) of this section shall be required only to the extent necessary to take into account revisions made in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget.
  (e) Alteration of allocations
     At any time after a committee reports the allocations required to be made under subsection (b) of this section, such committee may report to its House an alteration of such allocations. Any alteration of such allocations must be consistent with any actions already taken by its House on legislation within the committee“s jurisdiction.
  (f) Legislation subject to point of order
    (1) In the House of Representatives
       After the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in the House of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, or amendment providing new budget authority for such fiscal year or new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or any conference report on any such bill or joint resolution, if–
      (A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;
      (B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or
      (C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,
       would cause the appropriate allocation made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year of new discretionary budget authority or new entitlement authority to be exceeded.
    (2) In the Senate
       At any time after the Congress has completed action on the concurrent resolution on the budget required to be reported under section 632(a) of this title for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, that provides for budget outlays, new budget authority, or new spending authority (as defined in section 651(c)(2) of this title) in excess of (A) the appropriate allocation of such outlays or authority reported under subsection (a) of this section, or (B) the appropriate allocation (if any) of such outlays or authority reported under subsection (b) of this section in connection with the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year or provides for social security outlays in excess of the appropriate allocation of social security outlays under subsection (a) of this section for the fiscal year of the resolution or for the total of that year and the 4 succeeding fiscal years. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Appropriations. In applying this paragraph–
      (A) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security revenues (including social security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this paragraph is applied) over the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget;
      (B) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed increased by the shortfall of estimated social security revenues (including social security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this paragraph is applied) below the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and
      (C) no provision of any bill or resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment of social security benefits.
       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised allocations under subsection (a) of this section and revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the application of the preceding sentence. Such revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be considered as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, and the appropriate committees shall report revised allocations pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
  (g) Determinations by Budget Committees
     For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, spending authority as described in section 651(c)(2) of this title, outlays, and new credit authority for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be.
