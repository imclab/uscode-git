  (a) Intervention or appearance
     Permission to intervene as a party or to appear as amicus curiae under section 288e of this title shall be of right and may be denied by a court only upon an express finding that such intervention or appearance is untimely and would significantly delay the pending action or that standing to intervene has not been established under section 2 of article III of the Constitution of the United States.
  (b) Compliance with admission requirements
     The Counsel, the Deputy Counsel, or any designated Assistant Counsel or counsel specially retained by the Office shall be entitled, for the purpose of performing his functions under this chapter, to enter an appearance in any proceeding before any court of the United States or of a State or political subdivision thereof without compliance with any requirement for admission to practice before such court, except that the authorization conferred by this subsection shall not apply with respect to the admission of any such person to practice before the United States Supreme Court.
  (c) Standing to sue; jurisdiction
     Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer standing on any party seeking to bring, or jurisdiction on any court with respect to, any civil or criminal action against Congress, either House of Congress, a Member of Congress, a committee or subcommittee of a House of Congress, any office or agency of Congress, or any officer or employee of a House of Congress or any office or agency of Congress.
