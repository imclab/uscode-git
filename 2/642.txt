  (a) Legislation subject to point of order
    (1) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, after the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report providing new budget authority for such fiscal year, providing new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or reducing revenues for such fiscal year,,\1\N if–
      (A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;
      (B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or
      (C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report;
         would cause the appropriate level of total new budget authority or total budget outlays set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level of total revenues set forth in such concurrent resolution except in the case that a declaration of war by the Congress is in effect.
    (2)      (A) After the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget, it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that would cause the appropriate level of total new budget authority or total budget outlays or social security outlays set forth for the first fiscal year in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget covering such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level of total revenues (or social security revenues to be less than the appropriate level of social security revenues) set forth for the first fiscal year covered by the resolution and for the period including the first fiscal year plus the following 4 fiscal years in such concurrent resolution.
      (B) In applying this paragraph–
        (i)          (I) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security revenues (including those provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) over the appropriate level of Social Security revenues specified in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget;
          (II) estimated social security revenues shall be deemed to be increased to the extent that estimated social security outlays are less (taking into account the effect of the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report to which this subsection is being applied) than the appropriate level of social security outlays in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget; and
        (ii)          (I) estimated Social Security outlays shall be deemed to be increased by the shortfall of estimated social security revenues (including Social Security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) below the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and
          (II) estimated social security revenues shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security outlays (including social security outlays provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) above the appropriate level of social security outlays specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and
        (iii) no provision of any bill or resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment of social security benefits.
           The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised allocations under section 633(a) of this title and revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the application of the preceding sentence. Such revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be considered as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, and the appropriate committees shall report revised allocations pursuant to section 633(b) of this title.
  (b) Exception in House
     Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply in the House of Representatives to any bill, resolution, or amendment which provides new budget authority or new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or to any conference report on any such bill or resolution, if–
    (1) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;
    (2) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or
    (3) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,
       would not cause the appropriate allocation of new discretionary budget authority or new entitlement authority made pursuant to section 633(a) of this title for such fiscal year, for the committee within whose jurisdiction such bill, resolution, or amendment falls, to be exceeded.
  (c) Determination of budget levels
     For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, new entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, as the case may be.
