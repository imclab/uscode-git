  (a) Instructions to effectuate pay-as-you-go in House of Representatives
     If legislation providing for a net reduction in revenues in any fiscal year (that, within the same measure, is not fully offset in that fiscal year by reductions in direct spending) is enacted, the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives may report, within 15 legislative days during a Congress, a pay-as-you-go reconciliation directive in the form of a concurrent resolutionâ€“
    (1) specifying the total amount by which revenues sufficient to eliminate the net deficit increase resulting from that legislation in each fiscal year are to be changed; and
    (2) directing that the committees having jurisdiction determine and recommend changes in the revenue law, bills, and resolutions to accomplish a change of such total amount.
  (b) Consideration of pay-as-you-go reconciliation legislation in House of Representatives
     In the House of Representatives, subsections (b) through (d) of section 641 of this title shall apply in the same manner as if the reconciliation directive described in subsection (a) of this section were a concurrent resolution on the budget.
