   A Representative or Representative-elect making request for the assignment of a vacant room may withdraw the same at any time and no one shall have pending at the same time more than one such request. The assignment of a new room to a Representative, upon his request, or the appointment of any Representative having an individual office room as chairman of a committee having a committee room, shall act as a relinquishment by him of the room previously assigned to him.
