  (c) Applicability of restriction on use of noncompetitive procedures
     The head of an executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures to enter into a task or delivery order contract under this section only if an exception in subsection (c) of section 253 of this title applies to the contract and the use of such procedures is approved in accordance with subsection (f) of such section.

    (1) The head of an executive agency may exercise the authority provided in this section–
      (A) to award a single task or delivery order contract; or

    (3) The regulations implementing this subsection shall–
