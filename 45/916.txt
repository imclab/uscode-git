  (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, until April 1, 1981, the provisions of this chapter shall be in lieu of any directed service on any line of the Milwaukee Railroad under section 11125 of title 49.
  (b) The Commission shall upon request provide for directed service, not to exceed 30 days during the period immediately prior to acquisition, on the Milwaukee Railroad under section 11125 of title 49. Such directed service shall be limited to those lines or line segments where legislation has been enacted by a State legislature prior to May 30, 1980, which would provide for such State to tender a bona fide offer for acquisition of such lines or line segments. The Commission may order directed service by the Milwaukee Railroad under this subsection without inclusion of a 6 percent profit factor. The Commission shall take the action described in this subsection only in the event that the Secretary of Transportation determines that such service cannot be continued under the Emergency Rail Service Assistance Act [45 U.S.C. 661 et seq.].
