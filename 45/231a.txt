  (a) Individuals eligible for annuities; disability standards; proof of continued disability
    (1) The following-described individuals, if they shall have completed ten years of service (or, for purposes of paragraphs (i), (iii), and (v), five years of service, all of which accrues after December 31, 1995) and shall have filed application for annuities, shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e), (f), and (h) of this section, be entitled to annuities in the amounts provided under section 231b of this title–
      (i) individuals who have attained retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(T3lK)]);
      (ii) individuals who have attained the age of sixty and have completed thirty years of service;
      (iii) individuals who have attained the age of sixty-two and have completed less than thirty years of service, but the annuity of such individuals shall be reduced by \1/180\ for each of the first 36 months that he or she is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(T3lK)]) when the annuity begins to accrue and by \1/240\ for each additional month that he or she is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act) when the annuity begins to accrue;
      (iv) individuals who have a current connection with the railroad industry, whose permanent physical or mental condition is such as to be disabling for work in their regular occupation, and who (A) have completed twenty years of service or (B) have attained the age of sixty; and
      (v) individuals whose permanent physical or mental condition is such that they are unable to engage in any regular employment.
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), the Board, with the cooperation of employers and employees, shall secure the establishment of standards determining the physical and mental conditions which permanently disqualify employees for work in the several occupations in the railroad industry, and the Board, employers, and employees shall cooperate in the promotion of the greatest practicable degree of uniformity in the standards applied by the several employers. An individual“s condition shall be deemed to be disabling for work in his regular occupation if he will have been disqualified by his employer for service in his regular occupation in accordance with the applicable standards so established; if the employee will not have been so disqualified by his employer, the Board shall determine whether his condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation in accordance with the standards generally established; and, if the employee“s regular occupation is not one with respect to which standards will have been established, the standards relating to a reasonably comparable occupation shall be used. If there is no such comparable occupation, the Board shall determine whether the employee“s condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation by determining whether under the practices generally prevailing in industries in which such occupation exists such condition is a permanent disqualification for work in such occupation. For purposes of this subdivision and paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), an employee“s ””regular occupation““ shall be deemed to be the occupation in which he will have been engaged in more calendar months than the calendar months in which he will have been engaged in any other occupation during the last preceding five calendar years, whether or not consecutive, in each of which years he will have earned wages or salary, except that, if an employee establishes that during the last fifteen consecutive calendar years he will have been engaged in another occupation in one-half or more of all the months in which he will have earned wages or salary, he may claim such other occupation as his regular occupation.
    (3) Such satisfactory proof shall be made from time to time as prescribed by the Board, of the disability provided for in paragraph (iv) or (v) of subdivision (1) and of the continuance of such disability (according to the standards applied in the establishment of such disability) until the employee attains retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(T3lK)]). If the individual fails to comply with the requirements prescribed by the Board as to proof of the continuance of the disability until he attains retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act), his right to an annuity by reason of such disability shall, except for good cause shown to the Board, cease, but without prejudice to his rights to any subsequent annuity to which he may be entitled.
    (4) An individual who is entitled to an annuity under paragraph (v) of subdivision (1), but who does not have at least ten years of service, shall, prior to the month in which the individual attains age 62, be entitled only to an annuity amount computed under section 231b(a) of this title (without regard to section 231b(a)(2) of this title) or section 231b(f)(3) of this title. Upon attainment of age 62, such an individual may also be entitled to an annuity amount computed under section 231b(b) of this title, but such annuity amount shall be reduced for early retirement in the same manner as if the individual were entitled to an annuity under subsection (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

       shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e) and (h) of this section, be entitled to a supplemental annuity in the amount provided under section 231b of this title: T3Provided, howeverK, That in cases where an individual“s annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section begins to accrue on other than the first day of the month, the amount of any supplemental annuity to which he is entitled for that month shall be reduced by one-thirtieth for each day with respect to which he is not entitled to an annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section.
  (c) Spouses eligible for annuities
    (1) The spouse of an individual, if–
      (i) such individual (A) is entitled to an annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section and (B) has attained the age of 60 and has completed thirty years of service or has attained the age of 62, and

    (1) No individual shall be entitled to an annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section until he shall have ceased to render compensated service to an employer as defined in section 231(a) of this title.
    (2) An annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be paid only if the applicant shall have relinquished such rights as he may have to return to the service of an employer: T3Provided, howeverK, That this requirement shall not apply to individuals mentioned in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of subsection (a)(1) of this section prior to attaining retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(T3lK)]): T3Provided furtherK, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding proviso and of clause (i) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, an annuity shall be paid to the spouse of an individual only if such individual shall have satisfied the requirements of this subdivision without regard to the preceding proviso: T3And provided furtherK, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the first proviso of this subdivision and of clause (iii) of subsection (b)(1) of this section, a supplemental annuity shall be paid to an individual only if such individual shall have satisfied the requirements of this subdivision without regard to the first proviso thereof.
    (3) No annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section or supplemental annuity under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be paid with respect to any month in which an individual in receipt of an annuity or supplemental annuity thereunder shall render compensated service to an employer. Individuals receiving annuities under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall report to the Board immediately all such compensated service.
    (4) No annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be paid to an individual with respect to any month in which the individual is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(T3lK)]) and is paid more than the monthly allowable earnings as defined in the section (after deduction of disability related work expenses) from employment or self-employment of any form: T3Provided, howeverK, That for purposes of this subdivision, if a payment in any one calendar month is for accruals in more than one calendar month, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the months in which accrued to the extent accrued in such month. Any such individual under the retirement age (as defined in section 216(T3lK) of the Social Security Act) shall report to the Board any such payment of earnings for such employment or self-employment before receipt and acceptance of an annuity for the second month following the month of such payment. A deduction shall be imposed, with respect to any such individual who fails to make such report, in the annuity or annuities otherwise due the individual, in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity for each month in which he is paid such earnings in such employment or self-employment, except that the first deduction imposed pursuant to this sentence shall in no case exceed an amount equal to the amount of the annuity otherwise due for the first month with respect to which the deduction is imposed. If pursuant to the first sentence of this subdivision an annuity was not paid to an individual with respect to one or more months in any calendar year, and it is subsequently established that the total amount of such individual“s earnings during such year as determined in accordance with that sentence (but exclusive of earnings for services described in subdivision (3)) did not exceed the amount of earnings computed by totaling the monthly allowable earnings as determined under this section for each month in the year (after deduction of disability related work expenses), the annuity with respect to such month or months, and any deduction imposed by reason of the failure to report earnings for such month or months under the third sentence of this subdivision, shall then be payable. If the total amount of such individual“s earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for services as described in subdivision (3) and after deduction of disability related work expenses) is in excess of the annual allowable earnings amount, the number of months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of the first and third sentences shall not exceed the number of months derived by dividing the amount by which such annual earnings exceed the annual allowable earnings amount by the monthly allowable earning amount determined under this section. If the computation under the preceding sentence results in a remainder greater than or equal to one-half, the number of months for which an annuity is not payable as determined under the preceding sentence shall be increased by one. The annual allowable earnings amount shall be computed by totaling the amount of monthly allowable earnings as determined under the first sentence of this subdivision for each month in the calender \6\N year. If the amount of the individual“s annuity has changed during the calendar year, any payment of annuities which become payable solely by reason of the limitations in the preceding three sentences shall be made first with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is larger. For purposes of this subdivision, ””the monthly allowable earnings““ shall be $700, except that for each year after 2007, ””the monthly allowable earnings““ amount shall be the larger of the amount for the previous year or the amount calculated by multiplying $700 by the ratio of the national average wage index for the year 2 calender \6\ years before the year for which the amount is being calculated to the national average wage index for the year 2005. The amount so computed will be rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.
    (5) The annuity of a spouse or divorced wife under subsection (c) of this section shall, with respect to any month, be subject to the same provisions of this subsection as the individual“s annuity. In addition, the annuity of a spouse under subsection (c) of this section shall not be payable for any month if the individual“s annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section is not payable for such month by reason of the provisions of this subsection.

In addition, such portion of the spouse“s or divorced wife“s annuity shall be subject to deductions if the individual“s annuity is subject to deductions under subdivision (1) in the same manner as if such portion of such spouse“s or divorced wife“s annuity were a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].
    (3) Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (1) from that portion of an individual“s annuity as is computed under section 231b(a) of this title for any month in which the annuity of such individual is reduced pursuant to section 231b(m) of this title. This subdivision shall be disregarded in determining the applicability and amount of deductions in a spouse“s annuity pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.
    (4) Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (2) from that portion of a spouse“s annuity as is computed under section 231c(a) of this title for any month in which the annuity of such spouse is reduced due to entitlement to a benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.].
    (5) If an annuity begins to accrue on other than the first day of a month, subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply in the year the annuity begins to accrue if the annuitant has no earnings in excess of the monthly exempt amount in such year after the annuity beginning date.
    (6)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B)–
        (i) that portion of the annuity for any month of an individual as is computed under section 231b(b) of this title and as adjusted under section 231b(g) of this title, plus any supplemental amount for such month under section 231b(e) of this title, and that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse as is computed under section 231c(b) of this title and as adjusted under section 231c(d) of this title, shall each be subject to a deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received by such individual from compensated service rendered in such month to the last person, or persons, by whom such individual was employed before the date on which the annuity of such individual under subsection (a)(1) of this section began to accrue; and
        (ii) that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse as is computed under section 231c(b) of this title and as adjusted under section 231c(d) of this title shall be subject to a deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received by such spouse from compensated service rendered in such month to the last person, or persons, by whom such spouse was employed before the date on which the annuity of such spouse under subsection (c)(1) of this section began to accrue.
      (B) Any deductions imposed by this subdivision for any month shall not exceed 50 percent of the annuity amount for such month to which such deductions apply.

For purposes of this subdivision the Board shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such determinations and such suspensions of payment of benefits in the manner and to the extent that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to take or to make under section 203(h)(3) of the Social Security Act if the survivors were receiving the annuities to which this subdivision applies under section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402]: T3Provided, howeverK, That in determining a survivor“s excess earnings for a year for the purposes of this subdivision there shall not be included his income from employment or self-employment during months beginning with the month with respect to which he ceases to be qualified for an annuity.
