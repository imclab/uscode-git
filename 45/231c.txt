    (7) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times after January 1, 1983, that monthly insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are increased, that portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, or under this subsection as in effect before amendment by section 1119(g) of Public Law 97–35, shall, if such survivor“s annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue before the effective date of such first increase under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], be reduced by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this section was increased, after any reduction under subsection (i) of this section, as a result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this section, as reduced under subsection (i) of this section, prior to such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.
    (8) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title or would have been reduced under such section 231b(g)(2) of this title if such deceased individual had been living at the time such survivor“s annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue (deeming for this purpose, if such individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title, that such individual became entitled to an annuity under paragraph (i) of such section 231a(a)(1) of this title in the month in which such individual died). In a case where the survivor of a deceased individual is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the reduction provided by the preceding sentence of this subdivision shall be equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual would have been reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title if the annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to reduction under section 231b(m) of this title.
