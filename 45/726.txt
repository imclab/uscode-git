  (a) General
     The Association is authorized, in accordance with the provisions of this section, and such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, to invest from time to time in the securities of the Corporation by purchasing (1) up to $1,000,000,000 of debentures issued by the Corporation, and (2) after the acquisition of such debentures, up to $2,629,000,000 of the series A preferred stock of the Corporation.
  (b) Purposes and procedure for investment
    (1) The Association is authorized to purchase debentures and, thereafter, series A preferred stock of the Corporation at such times and in such amounts as may be required and requested by the Corporation in accordance with the terms and conditions governing such purchases (which shall be prescribed by the Association), to provide–
      (A) for the modernization, rehabilitation and maintenance of rail properties of the Corporation;
      (B) for the acquisition of equipment and other capital needs;
      (C) for the refinancing of indebtedness which was incurred by the Corporation under section 721 of this title or which was incurred under section 725 of this title and assumed by the Corporation; or
      (D) working capital as contemplated by the final system plan.
    (2) Purchases of up to $1,000,000,000 of debentures and, thereafter, of up to $2,300,000,000 of series A preferred stock shall be made by the Association as required and requested by the Corporation, unless the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding that–
      (A) the Corporation has failed in any material respect to comply with any covenants or undertakings made to the Association and such failure remains uncorrected;
      (B) the Corporation has failed substantially (as determined by performance within the margins prescribed by the Board of Directors) to attain the overall operating (including rehabilitation) and financial results projected for the Corporation in the final system plan (including any modifications of such projected results and of the performance margins applicable to such projected results which are jointly approved by the Finance Committee and the Board of Directors and which would improve the possibility that the Corporation will attain such projected results and perform within such margins, as modified); or
      (C) it is not reasonably likely, taking into consideration all relevant factors including the overall operating (including rehabilitation) and financial results achieved by the Corporation, that the Corporation will be able to become financially self-sustaining without requiring Federal financial assistance substantially in excess of the amounts authorized in this section.
    (3)      (A) Amounts transferred to the Association pursuant to section 509(b)(1) \1\N of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 may be used to purchase series A preferred stock of the Corporation to provide for the implementation by the Corporation of a program to reduce the Corporation“s work force, if the Finance Committee finds that the implementation of such program will result in substantial savings to the United States.
      (B) An employee who ceases to be an employee as a result of the reduction of work force under a program implemented pursuant to this paragraph shall not, by reason of so ceasing to be an employee, or by reason of any work or employment entered into after so ceasing to be an employee, lose such employee“s current connection with the railroad industry for the purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].
    (4) Purchases of up to $329,000,000 of a series A preferred stock shall be made by the Association, subject to the availability of appropriations, as required and requested by the Corporation, if the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding that the Corporation has taken appropriate action to eliminate losses on light density lines and other lines which are unprofitable. Such action shall include the imposition of surcharges on such lines, the abandonment of such lines, and the transfer of such lines.
    (5) The authority of the Association to purchase debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall terminate October 21, 1986.
  (c) Finding, direction, and review by Congress
    (1) If the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, it may direct the Association–
      (A) not to purchase any debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation after the date of such affirmative finding; or
      (B) to purchase debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation, after the date of such affirmative finding, only in such amounts, at such times, and on such terms and conditions (notwithstanding subsection (e)(1) of this section) as the Finance Committee determines to be appropriate to the role of the Association as an investor in such debentures and series A preferred stock.
    (2) A copy of each affirmative finding, the reasons therefor, and each direction made by the Finance Committee under paragraph (1) of this subsection, together with the comments and recommendations thereon of the Board of Directors of the Association, shall be transmitted to the Congress by the Association within 10 days after the date on which the Finance Committee makes such finding and direction, or if not so transmitted, shall be transmitted by the Finance Committee. Each such direction so transmitted shall become finally effective and is required to be implemented by the Association, unless within the first period of 30 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date of its transmittal to Congress either House of Congress disapproves such direction (except that such direction shall become finally effective immediately upon approval of such direction by both Houses of Congress) in accordance with the procedures specified in section 688 of title 2. For purposes of this paragraph, continuity of session of Congress is broken only in the circumstances described in section 682(5) of title 2. During review by the Association and Congress, the Association shall take no action inconsistent with the direction of the Finance Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except to the extent the Association finds necessary, in its discretion, to assure continuous orderly operation of the Corporation.
    (3) If the Congress, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, disapproves a direction submitted to the Association pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Association shall continue to purchase the debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation as otherwise provided in this subchapter until such time as a direction is submitted under this section which is not so disapproved (or affirmatively approved). The powers of the Association and of the Board of Directors of the Association shall remain in effect except to the extent modified by any such direction. If any such direction is disapproved by either House of Congress, the Finance Committee may, not earlier than 30 days after the date of such disapproval, make (and the Board of Directors of the Association shall transmit) any additional affirmative finding and direction with respect to the same matter, which direction shall become effective in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. An affirmative finding and direction under this subsection, or action by the Association during a review thereof by the Congress, may not be held unlawful or set aside by any reviewing court on the ground that such finding and direction or action were not adequate to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A), (E), or (F) of section 706(2) of title 5.
    (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any terms and conditions governing its purchase of securities of the Corporation, the Association shall, upon written application by the Corporation at least 30 days prior to such investment, make an initial investment in debentures of the Corporation within 60 days after the date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title. Such initial investment shall be limited to such amounts as the Association and Finance Committee, acting jointly, determine are necessary for the continued and orderly operations of the Corporation prior to any additional investment.
    (5) Not later than 60 days after the date of conveyance pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title, the Association shall select 6 individuals to serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of section 741(d) of this title.
  (d) Terms and conditions
     Notwithstanding any other provision of State law, the debentures and the series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall have such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the final system plan or this subchapter, as may be prescribed by the Association, except as follows:
    (1) The Corporation shall not be required to issue to the Association additional shares of series A preferred stock of the Corporation as a dividend on any such stock.
    (2) The dividends payable on series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall not be cumulative and shall be paid in cash when and to the extent that there is ””cash available for restricted cash payments““, as that term is defined in the final system plan.
    (3) After the Association calls for redemption of the certificates of value, no shares of series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall be issued in lieu of interest on the debentures of the Corporation and, to the extent such interest is not payable in cash by reason of the absence of sufficient ””cash available for restricted cash payment““, the Corporation shall deliver to the holders of the debentures contingent interest notes in a face amount equal to such unpaid interest.
    (4) If the Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance Committee, acting jointly, modify the terms or conditions governing the purchase of debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of this section, or if the Finance Committee waives compliance with any term, condition, provision, or covenant of such securities pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this section, the Finance Committee may require the Corporation to issue contingent interest notes in such amount as, in the determination of the Finance Committee, will provide protection for the United States, in the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership of the Corporation, equal to the protection the United States would have had in the absence of such modification or waiver.
    (5) The contingent interest notes issued pursuant to this section shall bear interest compounded annually at the rate of 8 percent per annum and such notes and the accumulated interest thereon shall be payable only in the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership of the Corporation occurring prior to the repayment and redemption of all outstanding debentures and accumulated series A preferred stock of the Corporation. The contingent interest notes and the accumulated interest thereon shall have the same priority in bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership as the debentures of the Corporation. The other terms and conditions of the contingent interest notes shall be as set forth in an agreement to be entered into between the Association and the Corporation prior to issuance of any debentures.
  (e) Modifications, waivers, and conversions
    (1) The Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance Committee, acting jointly, may agree with the Corporation to modify any of the terms and conditions governing the purchase by the Association of securities of the Corporation, upon a finding that such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this chapter or the goals of the final system plan.
    (2) The Finance Committee may, in its discretion and upon a finding that such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this chapter or the goals of the final system plan, waive compliance with any term, condition, provision, or covenant of the securities of the Corporation held by the Association, including any provision of such securities with respect to redemption of principal or issuance price, payment of interest or dividends, or any term or condition governing the purchase of such securities.
    (3) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, there shall be no conversion of the debentures of the Corporation into series A preferred stock of the Corporation, as provided in the terms and conditions of the debentures and pursuant to the final system plan, unless the Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance Committee jointly determine to effect such conversion.
  (f) Employee stock ownership plan
    (1) The Association shall not invest the final $345,000,000 of the additional investment in the Corporation authorized by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Amendments of 1978 unless and until (A) the Corporation has in effect an employee stock ownership plan which satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3), and (B) the requirements of the other paragraphs of this subsection have been satisfied.
    (2) The employee stock ownership plan shall:
      (A) provide:
        (i) for a transfer to the plan and allocation to the accounts of plan participants in periodic installments of Series A preferred stock of the Corporation with a stated redemption value of at least $345,000,000 or any other securities in an amount determined by the Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee, as constituting a meaningful interest in the Corporation, or any combination thereof so determined by the Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee. The use of Series A preferred stock to fund the Employee Stock Ownership Plan shall not be interpreted to relieve ConRail of the responsibility for repaying in full to the United States Railway Association its indebtedness as represented by all shares originally issued under Public Law 94–210 and this chapter;
        (ii) for immediate vesting of the rights of participants to such securities upon allocation, subject to defeasance as a result of the plan“s termination which termination shall occur in the event that, by the end of the 120th month beginning after the month in which securities or interests therein are first allocated to participants“ accounts, the Corporation has not attained for two consecutive quarters positive net income and a freight labor cost to freight revenue ratio equal to the average such ratio for all Class I railroads in 1977, as determined pursuant to procedures adopted by the Corporation pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Association with the concurrence of the Finance Committee;
      (B) be an employee benefit plan which is designed to invest primarily in employer securities;
      (C) meets such other requirements (similar to requirements applicable to employee stock ownership plans as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26) as the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate may describe;
      (D) have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner which may be required by the Corporation“s articles of incorporation and bylaws then in effect; and
      (E) have been prepared in consultation with, and been approved by, the Association and the Finance Committee.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a plan does not meet the requirements of section 401 of title 26–
      (A) stock transferred under paragraph (2) and allocated to the account of any participant under paragraph (2) shall not be considered income of the participant or his beneficiary under title 26 until such stock or dividends are actually distributed or made available to the participant or his beneficiary and, at such time, shall be taxable under section 72 of title 26 (treating the participant or his beneficiary as having a basis of 0 in the stock);
      (B) no amount shall be allocated to any participant under the plan in excess of the amount which might be allocated if the plan met the requirements of section 401 of title 26; and
      (C) the plan must meet the requirements of sections 410 and 415 of title 26.
    (4) The Corporation shall adopt such terms and conditions governing the securities of interests therein to be transferred to the plan (including limitations on voting rights) as the Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee, determines are necessary to protect reasonably the interests of the United States in the litigation pursuant to section 743(c) of this title and in the event of any action to further reorganize or restructure the Corporation“s assets or capital structure.
    (5) The Corporation, the Association, and a representative appointed by the Chairman of the Railway Labor Executives“ Association as representative of all the classes or crafts of employees of the Corporation shall engage in negotiations to agree upon a plan in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the Railway Labor Executives“ Association shall be deemed to represent all of the representatives of crafts or classes of employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries as though that organization held powers of attorney from each representative of a craft or class for the limited purposes of negotiating and agreeing upon an employee stock ownership plan. The parties shall incorporate their agreement into a written plan instrument specifying the terms and conditions set forth in this subsection and such other terms and conditions as they may decide upon, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee, unless the parties are unable to reach on \2\N an agreement on the plan following the exertion of every reasonable effort to do so, in accordance with the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], in which event, the Corporation and the Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee, shall establish a written plan with such terms and conditions as they may agree upon in accordance with this subsection. The plan shall not be subject to change under the provisions of section 6 of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 156] until after such time as securities have been distributed from the plan to the participants in the plan or their beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the plan. Within one year after November 1, 1978, the Corporation shall transmit a draft of such plan to the Congress and shall report on its progress in establishing and administering the plan. The report shall include recommendations of contractual and statutory provisions necessary to reasonably (A) exempt any Trustee of the plan, the Corporation, the Association, any member of the Finance Committee, and any other person from any fiduciary duty, responsibility or liability for the acquisition of, investment in, or retention of any security or interest therein of the Corporation or for any other transaction contemplated by this subsection and (B) provide for the United States to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless such persons against any and all liabilities, claims, actions, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and costs and expenses actually incurred in connection with any matter so exempted in which it is determined that such persons were acting in good faith and in a manner they believed to not be opposed to the best interests of the plan.
    (6) Within fourteen months of November 1, 1978, the Association shall report to the Congress on the draft plan and on any legal obstacle to the ability of the Corporation to effectuate and implement an employee stock ownership plan of the nature contemplated by this subsection, including specific recommendations on amendments to this subsection and other relevant laws which would harmonize the requirements of this subsection with those other laws. The Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury, as each finds appropriate, shall provide separate comments to the Association for inclusion with such report.
    (7) For the purposes of this subsection, the officers of each duly authorized representative of the crafts or classes of the employees of the Corporation who have been given leaves of absence by the Corporation to serve as such officers, are to be eligible to participate in such plan on the same basis as are employees whose employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement with the Corporation.
    (8)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, no person described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall have or be subject to any fiduciary responsibility, obligation, or duty, nor shall any such person be subject to civil liability, under any Federal or State law, as a fiduciary or otherwise–

      (D) Neither this paragraph nor paragraph (9) of this subsection shall be construed to grant immunity from any criminal law of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia.
