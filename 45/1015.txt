  (a) In the event agreement cannot be reached between any railroad subject to section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, or subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11, which has ceased to provide passenger commuter service over any line of the railroad and any party desiring to provide commuter service, the Commission shall order directed service, for the 3-year period beginning on May 30, 1980, over any passenger commuter line of the railroad that was in operation on March 1, 1980, if the directed service carrier agrees to provide such service without payment under section 11125(b)(5) of title 49. If the parties are unable to agree on compensation, the trustee of the railroad shall receive compensation for the property and facilities of the railroad on terms determined by the Commission to be reasonable.
