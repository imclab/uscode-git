    (1) Authority of Secretary
       In lieu of or in combination with appropriations of budget authority to cover the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees as required under section 661c(b)(1) of title 2, the Secretary may accept on behalf of an applicant for assistance under this section a commitment from a non-Federal source to fund in whole or in part credit risk premiums with respect to the loan that is the subject of the application. In no event shall the aggregate of appropriations of budget authority and credit risk premiums described in this paragraph with respect to a direct loan or loan guarantee be less than the cost of that direct loan or loan guarantee.
    (2) Credit risk premium amount
       The Secretary shall determine the amount required for credit risk premiums under this subsection on the basis of–
      (A) the circumstances of the applicant, including the amount of collateral offered, if any;
      (B) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;
      (C) historical data on the repayment history of similar borrowers;
      (D) consultation with the Congressional Budget Office;
      (E) the size and characteristics of the cohort of which the loan or loan guarantee is a member; and

    (3) Payment of premiums
       Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to the Secretary before the disbursement of loan amounts.
    (4) Cohorts of loans
       In order to maintain sufficient balances of credit risk premiums to adequately protect the Federal Government from risk of default, while minimizing the length of time the Government retains possession of those balances, the Secretary shall establish cohorts of loans. When all obligations attached to a cohort of loans have been satisfied, credit risk premiums paid for the cohort, and interest accrued thereon, which were not used to mitigate losses shall be returned to the original source on a pro rata basis. A cohort may include loans and loan guarantees. The Secretary shall not establish any limit on the proportion of a cohort that may be used for 1 loan or loan guarantee.
  (g) Prerequisites for assistance
     The Secretary shall not make a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section unless the Secretary has made a finding in writing that–
    (1) repayment of the obligation is required to be made within a term of not more than 35 years from the date of its execution;
    (2) the direct loan or loan guarantee is justified by the present and probable future demand for rail services or intermodal facilities;
    (3) the applicant has given reasonable assurances that the facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation will be economically and efficiently utilized;
    (4) the obligation can reasonably be repaid, using an appropriate combination of credit risk premiums and collateral offered by the applicant to protect the Federal Government; and
    (5) the purposes of the direct loan or loan guarantee are consistent with subsection (b) of this section.
  (h) Conditions of assistance
    (1) The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended–
      (A) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or intermodal operations for purposes not related to such operations, if such use would impair the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant under this section;
      (B) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis; and
      (C) will not make any discretionary dividend payments that unreasonably conflict with the purposes stated in subsection (b) of this section.
    (2) The Secretary shall not require an applicant for a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section to provide collateral. Any collateral provided or thereafter enhanced shall be valued as a going concern after giving effect to the present value of improvements contemplated by the completion and operation of the project. The Secretary shall not require that an applicant for a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section have previously sought the financial assistance requested from another source.
    (3) The Secretary shall require recipients of direct loans or loan guarantees under this section to comply with–

      (B) the protective arrangements established under section 836 of this title, with respect to employees affected by actions taken in connection with the project to be financed by the loan or loan guarantee.
        (i) Time limit for approval or disapproval
           Not later than 90 days after receiving a complete application for a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section, the Secretary shall approve or disapprove the application.
        (j) Repayment schedules
          (1) In general
             The Secretary shall establish a repayment schedule requiring payments to commence not later than the sixth anniversary date of the original loan disbursement.
          (2) Accrual
             Interest shall accrue as of the date of disbursement, and shall be amortized over the remaining term of the loan beginning at the time the payments begin.
