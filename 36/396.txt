   Any amateur sports organization which conducts amateur athletic competition, participation in which is restricted to a specific class of amateur athletes (such as high school students, college students, members of the Armed Forces, or similar groups or categories), shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such competition. If such an amateur sports organization wishes to conduct international amateur athletic competition to be held in the United States, or sponsor international amateur athletic competition to be held outside the United States, it shall obtain a sanction from the appropriate national governing body.
