  (a) No part of the income or assets of the corporation shall inure to any member, officer, or director, or be distributable to any such person during the life of the corporation or upon dissolution or final liquidation. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of reasonable compensation to officers of the corporation in amounts approved by the board of directors of the corporation.
  (b) The corporation shall not make loans to its officers, directors, or employees. Any director who votes for or assents to the making of a loan to an officer, director, or employee of the corporation, and any officer who participates in the making of such loan, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the amount of such loan until the repayment thereof.
