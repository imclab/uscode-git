  (a) No part of the income or assets of the corporation shall inure to any member, director, officer, or employee of the corporation or be distributable to any person during the life of the corporation or upon its dissolution or final liquidation. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of reasonable compensation to officers and employees of the corporation or to prevent their reimbursement for actual necessary expenses in amounts approved by the corporationâ€œs board of directors.
  (b) The corporation shall not make loans to its members, officers, directors, or employees. Any director who votes for or assents to the making of such a loan, and any officer who participates in the making of such a loan, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the amount of such loan until the repayment thereof.
