      (A) suspend the recognition of such national governing body;
      (B) revoke the recognition of such national governing body; or

     Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.
