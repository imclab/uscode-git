    (2) that increases in imports of articles like or directly competitive with the agricultural commodity, or class of goods within the agricultural commodity, produced by the group contributed importantly to the decline in price described in paragraph (1).
  (d) Special rule for qualified subsequent years
     A group of agricultural commodity producers certified as eligible under section 2401b of this title shall be eligible to apply for assistance under this part in any qualified year after the year the group is first certified, if the Secretary determines that–

       The term ””qualified year““, with respect to a group of agricultural commodity producers certified as eligible under section 2401b of this title, means each consecutive year after the year in which the group is certified and in which the Secretary makes the determination under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, as the case may be.
    (2) Classes of goods within a commodity
       In any case in which there are separate classes of goods within an agricultural commodity, the Secretary shall treat each class as a separate commodity in determining group eligibility, the national average price, and level of imports under this section and section 2401e of this title.
