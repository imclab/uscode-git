  (a) In general
    (1) If the Secretary determines, with respect to an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent worker, that–

        (ii) The Secretary shall ensure that not less than 90 percent of the funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title for a fiscal year are distributed to the States by not later than July 15 of that fiscal year.
      (C)        (i) In making the initial distribution of funds pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall hold in reserve 35 percent of the funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title for that fiscal year for additional distributions during the remainder of the fiscal year.
        (ii) Subject to clause (iii), in determining how to apportion the initial distribution of funds pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) in a fiscal year, the Secretary shall take into account, with respect to each State–
          (I) the trend in the number of workers covered by certifications of eligibility under this part during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;
          (II) the trend in the number of workers participating in training under this section during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;
