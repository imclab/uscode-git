      (A) shall, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, prohibit the procurement, after the date on which any waiver under section 2511(a) of this title first takes effect, of products–
        (i) which are products of a foreign country or instrumentality which is not designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this title, and
        (ii) which would otherwise be eligible products; and
      (B) may, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, take such other actions within the President“s authority as the President deems necessary.
    (2) Exception
       Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of procurements for which–
      (A) there are no offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products; or
      (B) the offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the United States Government.
  (b) Deferrals and waivers
     Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, but in furtherance of the objective of encouraging countries to become parties to the Agreement and provide appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to United States products and suppliers of such products, the President may–
    (1) waive the prohibition required by subsection (a)(1) of this section on procurement of products of a foreign country or instrumentality which has not yet become a party to the Agreement but–
      (A) has agreed to apply transparent and competitive procedures to its government procurement equivalent to those in the Agreement, and
      (B) maintains and enforces effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with its government procurement;
    (2) authorize agency heads to waive, subject to interagency review and general policy guidance by the organization established under section 1872(a) of this title, such prohibition on a case-by-case basis when in the national interest; and

       On or before July 1, 1981, the President shall report to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate on the effects on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget) of the refusal of developed countries to allow the Agreement to cover the entities of the governments of such countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors.
    (2) Recommendations for attaining reciprocity
       The report required by paragraph (1) shall include an evaluation of alternative means to obtain equity and reciprocity in such product sectors, including (A) prohibiting the procurement of products of such countries by United States entities not covered by the Agreement, and (B) modifying the application of chapter 83 of title 41. The report shall include an analysis of the effect of such alternative means on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget), and on successful negotiations on the expansion of the coverage of the Agreement pursuant to section 2514(a) and (b) of this title, other trade negotiating objectives, the relationship of the Federal Government to State and local governments, and such other factors as the President deems appropriate.
    (3) Consultation
       In the preparation of the report required by paragraph (1) and the evaluation and analysis required by paragraph (2), the President shall consult with representatives of the public, industry, and labor, and make available pertinent, nonconfidential information obtained in the course of such preparation to the advisory committees established pursuant to section 2155 of this title.

Prior to submitting such a bill, the President shall consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress having jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such action, and shall submit to such committees a proposed draft of such bill.
      (B) Congressional consideration
