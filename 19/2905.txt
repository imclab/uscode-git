      (A) the exports of such major foreign country, or
      (B) the goods of such major foreign country that are subject to competition from goods imported into such foreign country; and
    (2) whether such state trading enterprises–
      (A) unduly burden and restrict, or adversely affect, the foreign trade of the United States or the United States economy, or
      (B) are likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect.

        (i) will–
          (I) make purchases which are not for the use of such foreign country, and
          (II) make sales in international trade,
              in accordance with commercial considerations (including price, quality, availability, marketability, and transportation), and
        (ii) will afford United States business firms adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary practice, to compete for participation in such purchases or sales; or
      (B) a bill submitted under subsection (c) of this section which approves of the extension of the application of the GATT 1947 or the WTO Agreement between the United States and such major foreign country is enacted into law.
