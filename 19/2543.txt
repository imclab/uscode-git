  (a) Oversight and consultation
     The Secretary concerned shall–
    (1) inform, and consult and coordinate with, the Trade Representative with respect to international standards-related activities identified under paragraph (2);
    (2) keep adequately informed regarding international standards-related activities and identify those that may substantially affect the commerce of the United States; and
    (3) carry out such functions as are required under subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
  (b) Representation of United States interests by private persons
    (1) Definitions
       For purposes of this subsection–
      (A) Organization member
         The term ””organization member““ means the private person who holds membership in a private international standards organization.
      (B) Private international standards organization
         The term ””private international standards organization““ means any international standards organization before which the interests of the United States are represented by a private person who is officially recognized by that organization for such purpose.
    (2) In general
       Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, the representation of United States interests before any private international standards organization shall be carried out by the organization member.
    (3) Inadequate representation
       If the Secretary concerned, after inquiry instituted on his own motion or at the request of any private person, Federal agency, or State agency having an interest therein, has reason to believe that the participation by the organization member in the proceedings of a private international standards organization will not result in the adequate representation of United States interests that are, or may be, affected by the activities of such organization (particularly with regard to the potential impact of any such activity on the international trade of the United States), the Secretary concerned shall immediately notify the organization member concerned. During any such inquiry, the Secretary concerned may solicit and consider the advice of the appropriate representatives referred to in section 2547 of this title.
    (4) Action by organization member
       If within the 90-day period after the date on which notification is received under paragraph (3) (or such shorter period as the Secretary concerned determines to be necessary in extraordinary circumstances), the organization member demonstrates to the Secretary concerned its willingness and ability to represent adequately United States interests before the private international standards organization, the Secretary concerned shall take no further action under this subsection.
    (5) Action by Secretary concerned
       If–
      (A) within the appropriate period referred to in paragraph (4), the organization member does not respond to the Secretary concerned with respect to the notification, or does respond but does not demonstrate to the Secretary concerned the requisite willingness and ability to represent adequately United States interests; or
      (B) there is no organization member of the private international standards organization;
       the Secretary concerned shall make appropriate arrangements to provide for the adequate representation of United States interests. In cases where subparagraph (A) applies, such provision shall be made by the Secretary concerned through the appropriate organization member if the private international standards organization involved requires representation by that member.
  (c) Representation of United States interests by Federal agencies
     With respect to any international standards organization before which the interests of the United States are represented by one or more Federal agencies that are officially recognized by that organization for such purpose, the Secretary concerned shall–
    (1) encourage cooperation among interested Federal agencies with a view toward facilitating the development of a uniform position with respect to the technical activities with which the organization is concerned;
    (2) encourage such Federal agencies to seek information from, and to cooperate with, the affected domestic interests when undertaking such representation; and
    (3) not preempt the responsibilities of any Federal agency that has jurisdiction with respect to the activities undertaken by such organization, unless requested to do so by such agency.
