    (5) the accession of a state or separate customs territory to the WTO Agreement, or
    (6) the adoption of any other decision,
       if the action described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) would substantially affect the rights or obligations of the United States under the WTO Agreement or another multilateral trade agreement or potentially entails a change in Federal or State law.
