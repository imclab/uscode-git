      (A) identify and analyze acts, policies, or practices of each foreign country which constitute significant barriers to, or distortions of–
        (i) United States exports of goods or services (including agricultural commodities; and property protected by trademarks, patents, and copyrights exported or licensed by United States persons), and
        (ii) foreign direct investment by United States persons, especially if such investment has implications for trade in goods or services;

      (C) make an estimate, if feasible, of–
        (i) the value of additional goods and services of the United States, and
        (ii) the value of additional foreign direct investment by United States persons,
       that would have been exported to, or invested in, each foreign country during such calendar year if each of such acts, policies, and practices of such country did not exist.
    (2) Certain factors taken into account in making analysis and estimate
       In making any analysis or estimate under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall take into account–
      (A) the relative impact of the act, policy, or practice on United States commerce;
      (B) the availability of information to document prices, market shares, and other matters necessary to demonstrate the effects of the act, policy, or practice;
      (C) the extent to which such act, policy, or practice is subject to international agreements to which the United States is a party;
      (D) any advice given through appropriate committees established pursuant to section 2155 of this title; and
      (E) the actual increase in–
        (i) the value of goods and services of the United States exported to, and

       the foreign country during the calendar year for which the estimate under paragraph (1)(C) is made.
    (3) Annual revisions and updates
       The Trade Representative shall annually revise and update the analysis and estimate under paragraph (1).
  (b) Reports
    (1) In general
       On or before April 30, 1989, and on or before March 31 of each succeeding calendar year, the Trade Representative shall submit a report on the analysis and estimates made under subsection (a) of this section for the calendar year preceding such calendar year (which shall be known as the ””National Trade Estimate““) to the President, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and appropriate committees of the House of Representatives.
    (2) Reports to include information with respect to action being taken
       The Trade Representative shall include in each report submitted under paragraph (1) information with respect to any action taken (or the reasons for no action taken) to eliminate any act, policy, or practice identified under subsection (a), including, but not limited to–
      (A) any action under section 2411 of this title,
      (B) negotiations or consultations with foreign governments, or
      (C) a section on foreign anticompetitive practices, the toleration of which by foreign governments is adversely affecting exports of United States goods or services.
    (3) Consultation with Congress on trade policy priorities
       The Trade Representative shall keep the committees described in paragraph (1) currently informed with respect to trade policy priorities for the purposes of expanding market opportunities. After the submission of the report required by paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall also consult periodically with, and take into account the views of, the committees described in that paragraph regarding means to address the foreign trade barriers identified in the report, including the possible initiation of investigations under section 2412 of this title or other trade actions.

In preparing the section of the report required by subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section, the Trade Representative shall consult in particular with the Attorney General.
    (2) Restrictions on release or use of information
