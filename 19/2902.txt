  (a) Agreements regarding tariff barriers
    (1) Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this title will be promoted thereby, the President–
      (A) before June 1, 1993, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries; and
      (B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), proclaim–
        (i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
        (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or
        (iii) such additional duties;
       as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
    (2) No proclamation may be made under subsection (a) of this section that–
      (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on August 23, 1988) to a rate which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on August 23, 1988; or
      (B) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applies on August 23, 1988.
    (3)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed in paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article.
      (B) No staging under subparagraph (A) is required with respect to a rate reduction that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that is not produced in the United States. The United States International Trade Commission shall advise the President of the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.
    (4) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (3), the President may round an annual reduction by the lesser of–
      (A) the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
      (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
    (5) No reduction in a rate of duty under a trade agreement entered into under subsection (a) of this section on any article may take effect more than 10 years after the effective date of the first reduction under paragraph (1) that is proclaimed to carry out the trade agreement with respect to such article.
    (6) A rate of duty reduction or increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction or increase is included within an implementing bill provided for under section 2903 of this title and that bill is enacted into law.
  (b) Agreements regarding nontariff barriers
    (1) Whenever the President determines that any barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade–
      (A) unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy; or
      (B) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect;
         and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this title will be promoted thereby, the President may, before June 1, 1993, enter into a trade agreement with foreign countries providing for–
        (i) the reduction or elimination of such barrier or other distortion; or
        (ii) the prohibition of, or limitations on the imposition of, such barrier or other distortion.
    (2) A trade agreement may be entered into under this subsection only if such agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives described in section 2901 of this title.
  (c) Bilateral agreements regarding tariff and nontariff barriers
    (1) Before June 1, 1993, the President may enter into bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States. A trade agreement entered into under this paragraph may also provide for the reduction or elimination of barriers to, or other distortions of, the international trade of the foreign country or the United States.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with such other country.
    (3) A trade agreement may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any foreign country only if–
      (A) the agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives described in section 2901 of this title;
      (B) such foreign country requests the negotiation of such an agreement; and
      (C) the President, at least 60 days before the date notice is provided under section 2903(a)(1)(A) of this title–
        (i) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and
        (ii) consults with such committees regarding the negotiation of such agreement.
    (4) The 60-day period of time described in paragraph (3)(C) shall be computed in accordance with section 2903(e) of this title.
    (5) In any case in which there is an inconsistency between any provision of this Act and any bilateral free trade area agreement that entered into force and effect with respect to the United States before January 1, 1987, the provision shall not apply with respect to the foreign country that is party to that agreement.
  (d) Consultation with Congress before agreements entered into
    (1) Before the President enters into any trade agreement under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the President shall consult with–
