  (a) In general
     The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall describe and define forest ecosystems that are eligible for enrollment in the healthy forests reserve program.
  (b) Eligibility
     To be eligible for enrollment in the healthy forests reserve program, land shall be–
    (1) private land the enrollment of which will restore, enhance, or otherwise measurably increase the likelihood of recovery of a species listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; and
    (2) private land the enrollment of which will restore, enhance, or otherwise measurably improve the well-being of species that–
      (A) are not listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; but
      (B) are candidates for such listing, State-listed species, or special concern species.
  (c) Other considerations
     In enrolling land that satisfies the criteria under subsection (b), the Secretary of Agriculture shall give additional consideration to land the enrollment of which will–
    (1) improve biological diversity; and
    (2) increase carbon sequestration.
  (d) Enrollment by willing owners
     The Secretary of Agriculture shall enroll land in the healthy forests reserve program only with the consent of the owner of the land.
  (e) Maximum enrollment
     The total number of acres enrolled in the healthy forests reserve program shall not exceed 2,000,000 acres.
  (f) Methods of enrollment
    (1) In general
       Land may be enrolled in the healthy forests reserve program in accordance with–
      (A) a 10-year cost-share agreement;
      (B) a 30-year easement; or
      (C) an easement of not more than 99 years.
    (2) Proportion
       The extent to which each enrollment method is used shall be based on the approximate proportion of owner interest expressed in that method in comparison to the other methods.
  (g) Enrollment priority
    (1) Species
       The Secretary of Agriculture shall give priority to the enrollment of land that provides the greatest conservation benefit to–
      (A) primarily, species listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; and
      (B) secondarily, species that–
        (i) are not listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; but
        (ii) are candidates for such listing, State-listed species, or special concern species.
    (2) Cost-effectiveness
       The Secretary of Agriculture shall also consider the cost-effectiveness of each agreement or easement, and associated restoration plans, so as to maximize the environmental benefits per dollar expended.
