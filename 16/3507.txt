   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to change the existing relationship of other Federal laws to the law of a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or to relieve any person of any obligation imposed by any law of any State, or political subdivision of a State. No provision of this chapter shall be construed to invalidate any provision of State or local law unless there is a direct conflict between such provision and the law of the State, or political subdivision of the State, so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. This chapter shall in no way be interpreted to interfere with a Stateâ€œs right to protect, rehabilitate, preserve, and restore lands within its established boundary.
