   The purposes of this chapter are–
  (1) to enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, monitor, and regularly update practical science-based forest restoration treatments that will reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and improve the health of dry forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior West;
  (2) to synthesize and adapt scientific findings from conventional research programs to the implementation of forest and woodland restoration on a landscape scale;
  (3) to facilitate the transfer of interdisciplinary knowledge required to understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of wildfire on ecosystems and landscapes;
  (4) to require the Institutes established under this chapter to collaborate with Federal agencies–
    (A) to use ecological restoration treatments to reverse declining forest health and reduce the risk of severe wildfires across the forest landscape; and
    (B) to design, implement, monitor, and regularly revise representative wildfire treatments based on the use of adaptive ecosystem management;
  (5) to assist land managers in–
    (A) treating acres with restoration-based applications; and
    (B) using new management technologies (including the transfer of understandable information, assistance with environmental review, and field and classroom training and collaboration) to accomplish the goals identified in–
      (i) the National Fire Plan;
      (ii) the report entitled ””Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems-A Cohesive Strategy““ (65 Fed. Reg. 67480); and
      (iii) the report entitled ””10-Year Comprehensive Strategy: A Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment““ of the Western Governors“ Association;
  (6) to provide technical assistance to collaborative efforts by affected entities to develop, implement, and monitor adaptive ecosystem management restoration treatments that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible; and
  (7) to assist Federal and non-Federal land managers in providing information to the public on the role of fire and fire management in dry forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior West.
