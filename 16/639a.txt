   It is the sense of the Congress that the regular business loan program of the Small Business Administration should be reviewed by the Congress at least once every two years. It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after July 25, 1962, to provide additional authorization for such program on a two-year basis.
