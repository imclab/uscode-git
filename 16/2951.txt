     The Congress makes the following findings:
    (1) Pooling of international resources and scientific capabilities will be essential to a successful international global change program.

    (3) An international global change research program will be important in building future consensus on methods for reducing global environmental degradation.
    (4) The United States, as a world leader in environmental and Earth sciences, should help provide leadership in developing and implementing an international global change research program.

    (1) promote international, intergovernmental cooperation on global change research;
    (2) involve scientists and policymakers from developing nations in such cooperative global change research programs; and
