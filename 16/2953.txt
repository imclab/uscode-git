   Not more than 180 days after November 16, 1990, the President shall, in consultation with the Committee and all relevant Federal agencies, establish an Office of Global Change Research Information. The purpose of the Office shall be to disseminate to foreign governments, businesses, and institutions, as well as the citizens of foreign countries, scientific research information available in the United States which would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of global change. Such information shall include, but need not be limited to, results of scientific research and development on technologies useful forâ€“
  (1) reducing energy consumption through conservation and energy efficiency;
  (2) promoting the use of solar and renewable energy sources which reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere;
  (3) developing replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and other ozone-depleting substances which exhibit a significantly reduced potential for depleting stratospheric ozone;
  (4) promoting the conservation of forest resources which help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere;
  (5) assisting developing countries in ecological pest management practices and in the proper use of agricultural, and industrial chemicals; and
  (6) promoting recycling and source reduction of pollutants in order to reduce the volume of waste which must be disposed of, thus decreasing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
