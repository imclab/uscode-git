Before issuing a notice of violation, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State. The amount of the civil penalty shall be determined in accordance with considerations set forth in the Treaty and shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed, and with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.

  (b) Judicial review of assessment; procedures applicable
     Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review thereof in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint in such court within 30 days from the date of the order and by simultaneously serving a copy of the complaint by certified mail on the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, and the appropriate United States Attorney. The Secretary shall promptly file in the court a certified copy of the record upon which the violation was found or the penalty imposed.

  (c) Failure to pay assessment of civil penalty; recovery by Attorney General
     Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, if any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States.

The penalty shall constitute a maritime lien on the vessel which may be recovered in an action in rem in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the vessel.
  (e) Compromise, etc., of civil penalty
     The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of State, may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this section.
  (f) Conduct of hearings
     For the purposes of conducting any hearing under this section, the Secretary may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer oaths.

  (g) Waiver of referral to Attorney General
     If a vessel used in a violation of section 973c(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), or (13) or section 973c(b) of this title for which a civil penalty has been assessedâ€“

    (2) within 60 days after the penalty assessment has become final, leaves and remains outside of the Licensing Area, all Limited Areas closed to fishing, and all Closed Areas until the final penalty has been paid,
       there shall be no referral to the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section or in rem action under subsection (d) of this section in connection with such civil penalty.
