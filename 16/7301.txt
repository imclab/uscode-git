   The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes through a process that–
  (1) encourages ecological, economic, and social sustainability;
  (2) leverages local resources with national and private resources;
  (3) facilitates the reduction of wildfire management costs, including through reestablishing natural fire regimes and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire; and
  (4) demonstrates the degree to which–
    (A) various ecological restoration techniques–
      (i) achieve ecological and watershed health objectives; and
      (ii) affect wildfire activity and management costs; and
    (B) the use of forest restoration byproducts can offset treatment costs while benefitting local rural economies and improving forest health.
