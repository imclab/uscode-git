  (b) Terms of easement
     An owner granting an easement under subsection (a) of this section shall be required to provide for the restoration and protection of the functional values of wetland pursuant to a wetland easement conservation plan that–

      (A) the alteration of wildlife habitat and other natural features of such land, unless specifically permitted by the plan;
      (B) the spraying of such land with chemicals or the mowing of such land, except where such spraying or mowing is permitted by the plan or is necessary–
        (i) to comply with Federal or State noxious weed control laws; or
        (ii) to comply with a Federal or State emergency pest treatment program; and
      (C) any activities to be carried out on such participating landowner“s or successor“s land that is immediately adjacent to, and functionally related to, the land that is subject to the easement if such activities will alter, degrade, or otherwise diminish the functional value of the eligible land; and
      (D) the adoption of any other practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of this subpart, as determined by the Secretary;
    (3) provides for the efficient and effective restoration of the functional values of wetlands; and

     The development of a restoration plan, including any compatible use, under this section shall be made through the local Natural Resources Conservation Service representative, in consultation with the State technical committee.
  (d) Compatible uses
     Wetland reserve program lands may be used for compatible economic uses, including such activities as hunting and fishing, managed timber harvest, or periodic haying or grazing, if such use is specifically permitted by the plan and consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetlands resources for which the easement was established.
  (e) Type and length of easement
     A conservation easement granted under this section–
    (1) shall be in a recordable form; and
    (2) shall be for 30 years, permanent, or the maximum duration allowed under applicable State laws.
  (f) Compensation
     Compensation for easements acquired by the Secretary under this subpart shall be made in cash in such amount as is agreed to and specified in the easement agreement, but not to exceed the fair market value of the land less the fair market value of such land encumbered by the easement.

  (h) Restoration cost-share agreements
     The Secretary may enroll land into the wetlands reserve program through an agreement that requires the landowner to restore wetlands on the land, if the agreement does not provide the Secretary with an easement.
