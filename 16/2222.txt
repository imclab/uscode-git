  (a) Authorization; considerations
     The Administrator shall, within ten months of November 16, 1979, complete a study of the effectiveness of smoke detectors, heat detectors, and sprinkler suppression systems in saving lives, preventing injuries, and limiting property damage in fires, which report shall be submitted to the Congress and the President. In conducting such study, the Administrator shall consider, among other factors–
    (1) whether and the extent to which such devices and systems have been and are effective in reducing the severity of fires, including estimates with respect to the potential for savings in lives, and injury prevention attributable to the operation of such systems and devices;
    (2) the experience of Federal organizations, States, localities, and other political subdivisions which have required the use of such systems and devices; and
    (3) a description of Administration programs regarding smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler suppression systems and other systems, together with an analysis of the utilization of these systems and devices as a result of these programs.
  (b) Recommendations by Administrator
     If the Administrator determines, as a result of the study conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, that smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler suppression systems or other similar systems or devices either have been or may be of assistance in the detection and control of fire, the Administrator shall include, as part of the report conducted pursuant to this section, recommendations regarding what should be the Federal role, if any, with respect to creating incentives for the use of such devices or systems by the public, by business concerns, and by Federal, State, and local governments. In making such recommendations, the Administrator shall consider–
    (1) the incentives, including financial incentives, which might be developed to require or facilitate installation within new or existing buildings of smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler suppression systems, or any combination of such systems, or other similar systems and devices; and
    (2) the benefits, if any, of demonstration or other such programs directed at residents in high impact fire areas in order to increase the use of smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler suppression systems, or other systems or devices.
  (c) Legislative proposals
     As part of its report submitted pursuant to this section, the Administrator shall provide specific legislative proposals to the Congress for implementing any recommendations made pursuant to this section.
  (d) Availability of information, data, estimates, etc., from Federal departments
     Upon request of the Administrator, each Federal department and agency shall furnish to the Administrator such information, data, estimates, and statistics, and allow the Administrator access to all information in its possession, as the Administrator may reasonably determine to be necessary for the conduct of the study required by this section.
