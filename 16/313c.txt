   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the United States Weather Research Program, shall–
  (1) improve the capability to accurately forecast inland flooding (including inland flooding influenced by coastal and ocean storms) through research and modeling;
  (2) develop, test, and deploy a new flood warning index that will give the public and emergency management officials fuller, clearer, and more accurate information about the risks and dangers posed by expected floods;
  (3) train emergency management officials, National Weather Service personnel, meteorologists, and others as appropriate regarding improved forecasting techniques for inland flooding, risk management techniques, and use of the inland flood warning index developed under paragraph (2);
  (4) conduct outreach and education activities for local meteorologists and the public regarding the dangers and risks associated with inland flooding and the use and understanding of the inland flood warning index developed under paragraph (2); and
  (5) assess, through research and analysis of previous trends, among other activities–
    (A) the long-term trends in frequency and severity of inland flooding; and
    (B) how shifts in climate, development, and erosion patterns might make certain regions vulnerable to more continual or escalating flood damage in the future.
