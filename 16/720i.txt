   It is the sense of Congress that–
  (1) an Alaska natural gas transportation project would provide significant economic benefits to the United States and Canada; and
  (2) to maximize those benefits, the sponsors of the Alaska natural gas transportation project should make every effort to–
    (A) use steel that is manufactured in North America; and
    (B) negotiate a project labor agreement to expedite construction of the pipeline.
