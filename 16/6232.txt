      (C) Relation to minimum fee
         The reductions made under this paragraph may not reduce the land use fee for an organizational camp below the minimum land use fee required to be charged under paragraph (4).
      (D) Special considerations
         For purposes of determining the amount of the land use fee reduction required under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Secretary may not take into consideration the existence of sponsorships or scholarships to assist persons in attending the organizational camp.
    (4) Minimum land use fee
       The Secretary shall charge a minimum land use fee under paragraph (1) that represents, on average, the Secretaryâ€œs cost annually to administer an organizational camp special use authorization in the National Forest Region in which the organizational camp is located.

       Notwithstanding subsection (d), the facility use fees determined under paragraph (1) shall not be subject to a reduction or waiver.
  (c) Fee related to receipt of other revenues
     If an organizational camp derives revenue from the use of National Forest System lands or authorized facilities described in subsection (b) for purposes other than to introduce young people or individuals with a disability to activities that they may not otherwise experience and to educate them on natural resource issues, the Secretary shall charge, in addition to the land use fee imposed under subsection (a) and the facility use fee imposed under subsection (b), an additional fee equal to 5 percent of that revenue.
