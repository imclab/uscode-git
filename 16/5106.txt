  (a) Secretarial review of Commission determination of noncompliance
     Within 30 days after receiving a notification from the Commission under section 5105(b) of this title and after review of the Commission“s determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall make a finding on–
    (1) whether the State in question has failed to carry out its responsibility under section 5104 of this title; and
    (2) if so, whether the measures that the State has failed to implement and enforce are necessary for the conservation of the fishery in question.
  (b) Consideration of comments
     In making a finding under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall–
    (A) give careful consideration to the comments of the State that the Commission has determined under section 5105(a) of this title is not in compliance with a coastal fishery management plan, and provide such State, upon request, with the opportunity to meet with and present its comments directly to the Secretary; and
    (B) solicit and consider the comments of the Commission and the appropriate Councils.
  (c) Moratorium
    (1) Upon making a finding under subsection (a) of this section that a State has failed to carry out its responsibility under section 5104 of this title and that the measures it failed to implement and enforce are necessary for conservation, the Secretary shall declare a moratorium on fishing in the fishery in question within the waters of the noncomplying State. The Secretary shall specify the moratorium“s effective date, which shall be any date within 6 months after declaration of the moratorium.
    (2) If after a moratorium is declared under paragraph (1) the Secretary is notified by the Commission that the Commission is withdrawing under section 5105(c) of this title the determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall immediately determine whether the State is in compliance with the applicable plan. If so, the moratorium shall be terminated.

    (1) may provide for the possession and use of fish which have been produced in an aquaculture operation, subject to applicable State regulations; and
    (2) shall allow for retention of fish that are subject to a moratorium declared under this section and unavoidably taken as incidental catch in fisheries directed toward menhaden if–
      (A) discarding the retained fish is impracticable;
      (B) the retained fish do not constitute a significant portion of the catch of the vessel; and
      (C) retention of the fish will not, in the judgment of the Secretary, adversely affect the conservation of the species of fish retained.
