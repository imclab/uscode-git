  (a) The Congress finds that–
    (1) an unacceptable number of consumer products which present unreasonable risks of injury are distributed in commerce;
    (2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately;
    (3) the public should be protected against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;
    (4) control by State and local governments of unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products is inadequate and may be burdensome to manufacturers;
    (5) existing Federal authority to protect consumers from exposure to consumer products presenting unreasonable risks of injury is inadequate; and
    (6) regulation of consumer products the distribution or use of which affects interstate or foreign commerce is necessary to carry out this chapter.
  (b) The purposes of this chapter are–
    (1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;
    (2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;
    (3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and
    (4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.
