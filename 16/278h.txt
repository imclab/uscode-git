The Director shall designate such individuals as program managers.
    (2) Managers may be employees
       Program managers designated under paragraph (1) may be new or existing employees of the Institute or individuals on assignment at the Institute under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 [42 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.], except that individuals on assignment at the Institute under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 shall not directly manage such employees.
    (3) Manager responsibility
       Program managers designated under paragraph (1) shall be responsible for–
      (A) establishing and publicizing the broad research goals for the program;
      (B) soliciting applications for specific research projects to address the goals developed under subparagraph (A);
      (C) selecting research projects for support under the program from among applications submitted to the Institute, following consideration of–
        (i) the novelty and scientific and technical merit of the proposed projects;
        (ii) the demonstrated capabilities of the individual or individuals submitting the applications to successfully carry out the proposed research;
        (iii) the impact the proposed projects will have on increasing the number of computer security researchers;
        (iv) the nature of the participation by for-profit entities and the extent to which the proposed projects address the concerns of industry; and
        (v) other criteria determined by the Director, based on information specified for inclusion in applications under subsection (c) of this section; and
