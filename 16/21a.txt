   The boundary of the Yellowstone National Park is changed so as to read as follows:
   Beginning on the present north boundary line of Yellowstone National Park at its intersection with the hydrographic divide immediately north of Pebble Creek, approximately at park boundary monument 29 east; thence following said divide around the head of the drainage of Pebble Creek to its intersection with the present east boundary line of Yellowstone National Park, at a point near park boundary monument 54 north; thence southerly along said boundary line to its intersection with the hydrographic divide between Soda Butte and Cache Creeks, at a point near park boundary monument 51 north; thence easterly along said hydrographic divide to its intersection with the crest of the Absaroka Range; thence southerly along said crest to its intersection with the main hydrographic divide between Little Lamar River and the North Fork of Shoshone River, passing over Republic and Hoodoo Peaks; thence westerly along said divide passing over Notch Mountain to its intersection with the present east boundary line of Yellowstone National Park, at a point near park boundary monument 26 north; thence continuing westerly along said divide, now between the headwaters of Lamar River and Jones Creek; headwaters of Sedge, Bear, Cub, and Clear Creeks, and the headwaters of Jones and Crow Creeks, and between Crow Creek and Middle Creek, to its intersection with the present east boundary line of Yellowstone National Park, approximately at park boundary monument 18 north, passing over Pyramid and Cathedral Peaks, Mount Chittenden, and Avalanche Peak, thence southerly along said boundary line to its intersection with the hydrographic divide immediately south of Middle Creek, approximately at park boundary monument 15 north; thence westerly along said divide, now between a southern tributary of Middle Creek, headwaters of Beaverdam, Trappers, and Mountain Creeks, and the headwaters of Canfield and Eagle Creeks, to its intersection with the present east boundary line of Yellowstone National Park, at a point near park boundary monument 5 north, passing over Reservation and Atkins Peaks, Mount Schurz, Mount Humphreys, and Eagle Peak; and
   Beginning on the present west boundary line of Yellowstone National Park at its intersection with the left bank of Gallatin River between park monuments 45 and 46 north; thence northwesterly along said bank to a point opposite the hydrographic divide between Daly and Tepee Creeks; thence northeasterly across the Gallatin River and along said divide, around the headwaters of Daly, Black Butte, Specimen, and Fan Creeks, to the intersection of said divide with the present north boundary line of Yellowstone National Park, at a point near park boundary monument 11 west.
   All of those lands lying within the boundary lines above described and the present north, east, and west boundary lines are included in and made a part of the Yellowstone National Park; and all of those lands of the present Yellowstone National Park excluded from the park are included in and made a part of the contiguous national forests subject to all laws and regulations applicable to national forests, and upon acceptance thereof by appropriate action of the State, jurisdiction for all purposes whatsoever shall be, and is, ceded over the land excluded from the park to the State of Wyoming.
