  (b) Eligible lands
     The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart–
    (1) highly erodible croplands that–
      (A) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the production capability for future generations; or
      (B) can not be farmed in accordance with a plan under section 3812 of this title;
    (2) marginal pasture lands converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat prior to November 28, 1990;
    (3) marginal pasture lands to be devoted to trees in or near riparian areas or for similar water quality purposes, not to exceed 10 percent of the number of acres of land that is placed in the conservation reserve under this subpart in each of the 1991 through 2002 calendar years;
    (4) croplands that are otherwise not eligible–
      (A) if the Secretary determines that (i) such lands contribute to the degradation of water quality or would pose an on-site or off-site environmental threat to water quality if permitted to remain in agricultural production, and (ii) water quality objectives with respect to such land cannot be achieved under the water quality incentives program established under part II of this subchapter;
      (B) if such croplands are newly-created, permanent grass sod waterways, or are contour grass sod strips established and maintained as part of an approved conservation plan;
      (C) that will be devoted to newly established living snow fences, permanent wildlife habitat, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or filterstrips devoted to trees or shrubs; or
      (D) if the Secretary determines that such lands pose an off-farm environmental threat, or pose a threat of continued degradation of productivity due to soil salinity, if permitted to remain in production.
  (c) Certain land affected by secretarial action
     For purposes of determining the eligibility of land to be placed in the conservation reserve established under this subpart, land shall be considered planted to an agricultural commodity during a crop year if an action of the Secretary prevented land from being planted to the commodity during the crop year.
  (d) Maximum enrollment
     The Secretary may maintain up to 36,400,000 acres in the conservation reserve at any one time during the 1986 through 2002 calendar years (including contracts extended by the Secretary pursuant to section 1437(c) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–624; 16 U.S.C. 3831 note)).
