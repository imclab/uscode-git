  (a) In general
     Through the 2007 calendar year, the Secretary shall formulate and carry out a conservation reserve program under which land is enrolled through the use of contracts to assist owners and operators of land specified in subsection (b) of this section to conserve and improve the soil, water, and wildlife resources of such land.
  (b) Eligible land
     The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart–
    (1) highly erodible cropland that–
      (A)        (i) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the agricultural production capability for future generations; or
        (ii) cannot be farmed in accordance with a plan that complies with the requirements of subchapter II of this chapter; and
      (B) the Secretary determines had a cropping history or was considered to be planted for 4 of the 6 years preceding May 13, 2002 (except for land enrolled in the conservation reserve program as of May 13, 2002).
    (2) marginal pasture land converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat prior to November 28, 1990;
    (3) marginal pasture land to be devoted to appropriate vegetation, including trees, in or near riparian areas, or devoted to similar water quality purposes (including marginal pastureland converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat);
    (4) cropland that is otherwise ineligible if the Secretary determines that–
      (A) if permitted to remain in agricultural production, the land would–
        (i) contribute to the degradation of soil, water, or air quality; or
        (ii) pose an on-site or off-site environmental threat to soil, water, or air quality;
      (B) the land is a–
        (i) newly-created, permanent grass sod waterway; or
        (ii) a contour grass sod strip established and maintained as part of an approved conservation plan;
      (C) the land will be devoted to newly established living snow fences, permanent wildlife habitat, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or filterstrips devoted to trees or shrubs; or
      (D) the land poses an off-farm environmental threat, or a threat of continued degradation of productivity due to soil salinity, if permitted to remain in production; and
      (E) enrollment of the land would facilitate a net savings in groundwater or surface water resources of the agricultural operation of the producer;
    (5) the portion of land in a field not enrolled in the conservation reserve in a case in which more than 50 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a buffer, if–
      (A) the land is enrolled as part of the buffer; and
      (B) the remainder of the field is–
        (i) infeasible to farm; and
        (ii) enrolled at regular rental rates.
  (c) Planting status of certain land
     For purposes of determining the eligibility of land to be placed in the conservation reserve established under this subpart, land shall be considered to be planted to an agricultural commodity during a crop year if–
    (1) during the crop year, the land was devoted to a conserving use; or
    (2)      (A) during the crop year or during any of the 2 years preceding the crop year, the land was enrolled in the water bank program; and
      (B) the contract of the owner or operator of the cropland expired or will expire in calendar year 2000, 2001, or 2002.
  (d) Maximum enrollment
     The Secretary may maintain up to 39,200,000 acres in the conservation reserve at any 1 time during the 2002 through 2007 calendar years (including contracts extended by the Secretary pursuant to section 1437(c) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3831 note; Public Law 101–624)).

         In the case of land devoted to hardwood trees, shelterbelts, windbreaks, or wildlife corridors under a contract entered into under this subpart after October 1, 1990, and land devoted to such uses under contracts modified under section 3835a of this title, the owner or operator of the land may, within the limitations prescribed under this section, specify the duration of the contract.
      (B) Hardwood trees
         In the case of land that is devoted to hardwood trees under a contract entered into under this subpart prior to October 1, 1990, the Secretary may extend the contract for a term of not to exceed 5 years, as agreed to by the owner or operator of such land and the Secretary.
    (3) 1-year extension
