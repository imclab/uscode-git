      (C) The occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable, if such event occurs during the period the franchise is in effect and the franchisor first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of such occurrence–
        (i) not more than 120 days prior to the date on which notification of termination or nonrenewal is given, if notification is given pursuant to section 2804(a) of this title; or

      (E) In the case of any franchise entered into prior to June 19, 1978, and in the case of any franchise entered into or renewed on or after such date (the term of which is 3 years or longer, or with respect to which the franchisee was offered a term of 3 years or longer), a determination made by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business to withdraw from the marketing of motor fuel through retail outlets in the relevant geographic market area in which the marketing premises are located, if–
        (i) such determination–
          (I) was made after the date such franchise was entered into or renewed, and
          (II) was based upon the occurrence of changes in relevant facts and circumstances after such date;
        (ii) the termination or nonrenewal is not for the purpose of converting the premises, which are the subject of the franchise, to operation by employees or agents of the franchisor for such franchisor“s own account; and
        (iii) in the case of leased marketing premises–
          (I) the franchisor, during the 180-day period after notification was given pursuant to section 2804 of this title, either made a bona fide offer to sell, transfer, or assign to the franchisee such franchisor“s interests in such premises, or, if applicable, offered the franchisee a right of first refusal of at least 45 days duration of an offer, made by another, to purchase such franchisor“s interest in such premises; or

    (3) For purposes of this subsection, the following are grounds for nonrenewal of a franchise relationship:
      (A) The failure of the franchisor and the franchisee to agree to changes or additions to the provisions of the franchise, if–
        (i) such changes or additions are the result of determinations made by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business; and
        (ii) such failure is not the result of the franchisor“s insistence upon such changes or additions for the purpose of converting the leased marketing premises to operation by employees or agents of the franchisor for the benefit of the franchisor or otherwise preventing the renewal of the franchise relationship.
      (B) The receipt of numerous bona fide customer complaints by the franchisor concerning the franchisee“s operation of the marketing premises, if–
        (i) the franchisee was promptly apprised of the existence and nature of such complaints following receipt of such complaints by the franchisor; and

        (i) such determination is–
          (I) to convert the leased marketing premises to a use other than the sale or distribution of motor fuel,
          (II) to materially alter, add to, or replace such premises,
          (III) to sell such premises, or
          (IV) that renewal of the franchise relationship is likely to be uneconomical to the franchisor despite any reasonable changes or reasonable additions to the provisions of the franchise which may be acceptable to the franchisee;
        (ii) with respect to a determination referred to in subclause (II) or (IV), such determination is not made for the purpose of converting the leased marketing premises to operation by employees or agents of the franchisor for such franchisor“s own account; and
