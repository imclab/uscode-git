   The Administrator of the United States Fire Administration (hereafter in sections 2223a to 2223e of this title referred to as the ””Administrator““) shall conduct a review of existing response information used by emergency response personnel at the State and local levels to evaluate its accuracy and consistency, and to determine whether it is properly expressed. Such information should clearly communicate to emergency response personnel the probable hazards which they must contend with in an emergency situation involving hazardous materials, and the appropriate response to those hazards.
