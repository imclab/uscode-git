   Section 510, act Aug. 8, 1916, ch. 295, 39 Stat. 440, which applied the provisions of sections 506 to 508 and 509 of this title to lands within the national forests in Lawrence and Pennington Counties in South Dakota, was omitted because of the repeal of sections 506 to 508 and 509 of this title.
   Section 510a, act June 13, 1930, ch. 481, 46 Stat. 583, prohibiting the acceptance of applications for the classification and listing of lands in the Custer National Forest for homestead entry with provision for the Secretary of Agriculture to list, in his discretion, limited tracts when in his opinion such action would be in the public interest and would not be injurious to other settlers or users of the national forest, has been omitted in view of the repeal by Pub. L. 87–869, § 4, Oct. 23, 1962, 76 Stat. 1157, of the provision under which such classification and listing were carried out.
