   The Secretary of Commerce is directed to undertake a comprehensive continuing study of species of fish of the Atlantic coast, including bays, sounds, and tributaries, for the purpose of recommending to the States of such coast appropriate measures for the development and protection of such resources and their wisest utilization, whether for sports or commercial fishing or both, including the limitations on season, take per unit of time, per man, or per gear, or such other recommendations as will most effectively provide for the public the maximum production and utilization of such fish consistent with the maintenance of an adequate brood reserve.
