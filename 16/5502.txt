   The purposes of this chapter are to help ensure the continued leadership of the United States in high-performance computing and its applications by–
  (1) expanding Federal support for research, development, and application of high-performance computing in order to–
    (A) expand the number of researchers, educators, and students with training in high-performance computing and access to high-performance computing resources;
    (B) promote the further development of an information infrastructure of data bases, services, access mechanisms, and research facilities available for use through the Internet;
    (C) stimulate research on software technology;
    (D) promote the more rapid development and wider distribution of computing software tools and applications software;
    (E) accelerate the development of computing systems and subsystems;
    (F) provide for the application of high-performance computing to Grand Challenges;
    (G) invest in basic research and education, and promote the inclusion of high-performance computing into educational institutions at all levels; and
    (H) promote greater collaboration among government, Federal laboratories, industry, high-performance computing centers, and universities;
  (2) improving the interagency planning and coordination of Federal research and development on high-performance computing and maximizing the effectiveness of the Federal Government“s high-performance computing network research and development programs;
