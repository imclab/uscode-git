  (a) Statement of ownership of securities; duty to file
     Every person who is an officer or director of a registered holding company shall file with the Commission in such form as the Commission shall prescribe (1) at the time of the registration of such holding company, or within ten days after such person becomes an officer or director, a statement of the securities of such registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof of which he is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner, and (2) within ten days after the close of each calendar month thereafter, if there has been any change in such ownership during such month, a statement of such ownership as of the close of such calendar month and of the changes in such ownership that have occurred during such calendar month.
  (b) Limitation on profits in purchase and sale of securities
     For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by any such officer or director by reason of his relationship to such registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, any profit realized by any such officer or director from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any security of such registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof within any period of less than six months, unless such security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall inure to and be recoverable by the holding company or subsidiary company in respect of the security of which such profit was realized, irrespective of any intention on the part of such officer or director in entering into such transaction to hold the security purchased or not to repurchase the security sold for a period of more than six months. Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the company entitled thereto or by the owner of any security of such company in the name and in the behalf of such company if such company shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not cover any transaction where such person was not an officer or director at the times of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to give a remedy in the case of any transaction in respect of which a remedy is given under subsection (b) of section 78p of this title.
  (c) Officers or representatives of banking institutions disqualified to serve as officers or directors
     After one year from August 26, 1935, no registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof shall have, as an officer or director thereof, any executive officer, director, partner, appointee, or representative of any bank, trust company, investment banker, or banking association or firm, or any executive officer, director, partner, appointee, or representative of any corporation a majority of whose stock, having the unrestricted right to vote for the election of directors, is owned by any bank, trust company, investment banker, or banking association or firm, except in such cases as rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission may permit as not adversely affecting the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
