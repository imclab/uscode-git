  (a) Consistency
     Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as affecting the provisions of title III of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act [16 U.S.C. 1851 et seq.] as it applies with respect to fishery management plans and their application to any fishery, except that the Pacific Fishery Management Council shall ensure that existing and future fishery management plans are consistent with any recommended program approved under section 3311 of this title and any enhancement plan under subchapter III of this chapter.
  (b) Fleet mobility
     The Secretary of Commerce in coordination with the Pacific Fishery Management Council in its salmon management plan shall ensure that the fishing effort reduction that results from the fleet adjustment program of subchapter IV of this chapter and the license moratorium of the State of Washington is not replaced by new fishing effort from outside such State.
