No such stamp shall be valid under any circumstances to authorize the taking of migratory waterfowl except in compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations and then only when the person so taking such waterfowl shall himself have written his signature in ink across the face of the stamp prior to such taking. Such stamps shall be usable as migratory-bird hunting stamps only during the year for which issued. The Postal Service, pursuant to regulations prescribed by it, shall provide for the redemption, on or before the 30th day of June of each year, of blocks composed of two or more attached unused stamps issued for such year (A) that were sold on consignment to any person, including, but not limited to, retail dealers for resale to their customers, and (B) that have not been resold by any such person.

       have been obligated for expenditure. For purposes of this section, the term ””hunting year““ means the 12-month period beginning on July 1 of any such year.
