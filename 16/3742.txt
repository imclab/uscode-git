   The purposes of this chapter are to establish a partnership among the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, designated State agencies, and private organizations and individualsâ€“
  (1) to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects to conserve the entire array of diverse fish and wildlife species in the United States and to provide opportunities for the public to use and enjoy these fish and wildlife species through nonconsumptive activities;
  (2) to enable designated State agencies to respond more fully and utilize their statutory and administrative authorities by carrying out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects; and
  (3) to encourage private donations, under the leadership of the States and of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects.
