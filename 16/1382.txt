  (b) Cooperation by Federal agencies
     Each Federal agency is authorized and directed to cooperate with the Secretary, in such manner as may be mutually agreeable, in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.
  (c) Contracts, leases, and cooperative agreements
     The Secretary may enter into such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter or subchapter V of this chapter and on such terms as he deems appropriate with any Federal or State agency, public or private institution, or other person.
  (d) Annual review; suspension of program
     The Secretary shall review annually the operation of each program in which the United States participates involving the taking of marine mammals on lands.

  (e) Measures to alleviate impacts on strategic stocks
     If the Secretary determines, based on a stock assessment under section 1386 of this title or other significant new information obtained under this chapter, that impacts on rookeries, mating grounds, or other areas of similar ecological significance to marine mammals may be causing the decline or impeding the recovery of a strategic stock, the Secretary may develop and implement conservation or management measures to alleviate those impacts. Such measures shall be developed and implemented after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the appropriate Federal agencies and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
