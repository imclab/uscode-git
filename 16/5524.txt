  (c) Study of impact of Federal procurement regulations
    (1) The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a study to–
      (A) evaluate the impact of Federal procurement regulations that require that contractors providing software to the Federal Government share the rights to proprietary software development tools that the contractors use to develop the software; and
      (B) determine whether such regulations discourage development of improved software development tools and techniques.
    (2) The Secretary of Commerce shall, within one year after December 9, 1991, report to the Congress regarding the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1).
  (d) Authorization of appropriations
