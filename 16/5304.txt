In order for a proposal to be considered by the Secretary, the applicant shall have in existence at the time the proposal is submitted the following qualifications:
    (1) the technical capability to enable it to make use of existing research support and facilities in carrying out its research objectives;
    (2) a multidisciplinary research staff experienced in metal casting or other directly related technologies; and
    (3) the facilities and equipment capable of conducting at least laboratory scale testing or demonstration of metal casting or related processes.
  (b) Proposal criteria
     Each proposal shall–
    (1) demonstrate the support of the metal casting industry by describing–
      (A) how industry has participated in deciding what research activities will be undertaken;
      (B) how industry will participate in the evaluation of the applicant“s progress in research and development activities; and
      (C) the extent to which industry funds are committed to the applicant“s proposal;
    (2) have a commitment for matching funds from non-Federal sources, which shall consist of:
      (A) cash, or
      (B) as determined by the Secretary, the fair market value of equipment, services, materials, appropriate technology transfer activities, and other assets directly related to the proposal“s cost;
    (3) include a single or multiyear management plan that outlines how the research and development activities will be administered and carried out;
    (4) state the annual cost of the proposal and a breakdown of those costs; and
    (5) describe the technology transfer mechanisms the applicant will use to make available research results to industry and to other researchers.
  (c) Content of management plan
     The management plan set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall–
    (1) outline the basic research and development activities expected to be performed;
    (2) outline who will conduct those research activities;
    (3) establish the time frame over which the research activities will take place; and
    (4) define the overall program management and direction by–
      (A) identifying managerial, organizational and administrative procedures and responsibilities;
      (B) outlining how the coordination of research and development between the individuals and organizations involved will be achieved;
      (C) demonstrating how implementation and monitoring of the progress of research projects after receipt of funding from the Secretary will be achieved;
      (D) demonstrating how recommendations and implementations on modifications to the plan will be achieved; and
      (E) providing sufficient rationale to support the plan“s costs.
  (d) Selection of proposals
     From the proposals submitted, the Secretary shall select proposals for funding. The Secretary shall attempt to select at least four proposals. The Secretary shall select the proposals that–
    (1) will best result in carrying out needed metal casting research and development in one or more of the following general areas–
      (A) solidification and casting technologies;
      (B) computational modeling and design;
      (C) processing technologies and design for energy efficiency, material conservation, environmental protection, or industrial productivity; and
      (D) other areas of research, which in the judgment of the Secretary, after consulting with the Board established in section 5306 of this title, further the purposes of this chapter;
    (2) represent research and development in specific areas identified in the ””Metal Casting Research Priorities““ developed annually by the Board pursuant to section 5306(b)(1) of this title;
    (3) to the greatest extent possible and subject to available appropriations, ensure that at least one applicant is selected from each of the four census regions of the country where the metal casting industry is concentrated;
    (4) demonstrate strong industry support;
    (5) ensure the timely transfer of technology to industry; and
    (6) otherwise best carry out the purposes of this chapter.
  (e) Funding of program
     From amounts made available in separate appropriation Acts, the Secretary shall provide to each applicant selected the financial and technical assistance and other incentives that are necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
  (f) National Metal Casting Research Institute
     Each recipient of financial assistance under subsection (d) of this section shall be known as a ””National Metal Casting Research Institute““.
