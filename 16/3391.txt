  (a) General rule
     Not later than 120 days after November 9, 1978, the Secretary of Energy shall prescribe and make effective a rule, which may be amended from time to time, which provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than subsection (b) of this section) and to the maximum extent practicable, no curtailment plan of an interstate pipeline may provide for curtailment of deliveries of natural gas for any essential agricultural use, unless such curtailment–
    (1) does not reduce the quantity of natural gas delivered for such use below the use requirement specified in subsection (c) of this section; or
    (2) is necessary in order to meet the requirements of high-priority users.
  (b) Curtailment priority not applicable if alternative fuel available
     If the Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determines, by rule or order, that use of a fuel (other than natural gas) is economically practicable and that the fuel is reasonably available as an alternative for any agricultural use of natural gas, the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to any curtailment of deliveries for such use.
  (c) Determination of essential agricultural use requirements
     The Secretary of Agriculture shall certify to the Secretary of Energy and the Commission the natural gas requirements (expressed either as volumes or percentages of use) of persons (or classes thereof) for essential agricultural uses in order to meet the requirements of full food and fiber production.
  (d) Authority of Secretary of Agriculture to intervene
     The Secretary of Agriculture may intervene as a matter of right in any proceeding before the Commission which is conducted in connection with implementing the requirements of the rule prescribed under subsection (a) of this section.
  (e) Limitation
     The Secretary of Agriculture may not exercise any authority under this section for the purpose of restricting the production of any crop.
