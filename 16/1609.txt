Notwithstanding the provisions of section 473 of this title, no land now or hereafter reserved or withdrawn from the public domain as national forests pursuant to section 471 \1\N of this title, or any act supplementary to and amendatory thereof, shall be returned to the public domain except by an act of Congress.
