  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds and declares that–
    (1) various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation;
    (2) other species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been so depleted in numbers that they are in danger of or threatened with extinction;
    (3) these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people;
    (4) the United States has pledged itself as a sovereign state in the international community to conserve to the extent practicable the various species of fish or wildlife and plants facing extinction, pursuant to–
      (A) migratory bird treaties with Canada and Mexico;
      (B) the Migratory and Endangered Bird Treaty with Japan;
      (C) the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere;
      (D) the International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries;
      (E) the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean;
      (F) the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; and
      (G) other international agreements; and
    (5) encouraging the States and other interested parties, through Federal financial assistance and a system of incentives, to develop and maintain conservation programs which meet national and international standards is a key to meeting the Nation“s international commitments and to better safeguarding, for the benefit of all citizens, the Nation“s heritage in fish, wildlife, and plants.
