  (a) Establishment
     Upon conveyance to the United States of the Plum Creek offered lands in the Kelly Butte area, there is hereby established the Kelly Butte Special Management Area in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, comprising approximately 5,642 acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled ””Kelly Butte Special Management Area““, dated October 1998.

     The Kelly Butte Special Management Area shall be managed by the Secretary in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to National Forest System lands, and subject to the following additional provisions:
    (1) the Area shall be managed with special emphasis on:
      (A) preserving its natural character and protecting and enhancing water quality in the upper Green River watershed;
      (B) permitting hunting and fishing;
      (C) providing opportunities for primitive and semi-primitive recreation and scientific research and study;
      (D) protecting and enhancing populations of fish, wildlife and native plant species; and
      (E) allowing for traditional uses by native American peoples;
    (2) commercial timber harvest and road construction shall be prohibited;
    (3) the Area shall be closed to the use of motor vehicles, except as may be necessary for administrative purposes or in emergencies (including rescue operations) to protect public health and safety; and
    (4) the Area shall, subject to valid existing rights, be permanently withdrawn from all forms of entry and appropriation under the U.S. mining laws and mineral leasing laws, including the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 [30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].
  (c) No buffer zones
     Congress does not intend that the designation of the Kelly Butte Special Management Area lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the Area. The fact that non-compatible activities or uses can be seen or heard from within the Kelly Butte Special Management Area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the Area.
