  (a) Standardized fishing vessel registration and information management system
     The Secretary shall, in cooperation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the States, the Councils, and Marine Fisheries Commissions, develop recommendations for implementation of a standardized fishing vessel registration and information management system on a regional basis. The recommendations shall be developed after consultation with interested governmental and nongovernmental parties and shall–
    (1) be designed to standardize the requirements of vessel registration and information collection systems required by this chapter, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and any other marine resource law implemented by the Secretary, and, with the permission of a State, any marine resource law implemented by such State;
    (2) integrate information collection programs under existing fishery management plans into a non-duplicative information collection and management system;
    (3) avoid duplication of existing State, tribal, or Federal systems and shall utilize, to the maximum extent practicable, information collected from existing systems;
    (4) provide for implementation of the system through cooperative agreements with appropriate State, regional, or tribal entities and Marine Fisheries Commissions;
    (5) provide for funding (subject to appropriations) to assist appropriate State, regional, or tribal entities and Marine Fisheries Commissions in implementation;
    (6) establish standardized units of measurement, nomenclature, and formats for the collection and submission of information;
    (7) minimize the paperwork required for vessels registered under the system;
    (8) include all species of fish within the geographic areas of authority of the Councils and all fishing vessels including charter fishing vessels, but excluding recreational fishing vessels;
    (9) require United States fish processors, and fish dealers and other first ex-vessel purchasers of fish that are subject to the proposed system, to submit information (other than economic information) which may be necessary to meet the goals of the proposed system; and
    (10) include procedures necessary to ensure–
      (A) the confidentiality of information collected under this section in accordance with section 1881a(b) of this title; and
      (B) the timely release or availability to the public of information collected under this section consistent with section 1881a(b) of this title.
  (b) Fishing vessel registration
     The proposed registration system should, at a minimum, obtain the following information for each fishing vessel–
    (1) the name and official number or other identification, together with the name and address of the owner or operator or both;
    (2) gross tonnage, vessel capacity, type and quantity of fishing gear, mode of operation (catcher, catcher processor, or other), and such other pertinent information with respect to vessel characteristics as the Secretary may require; and
    (3) identification (by species, gear type, geographic area of operations, and season) of the fisheries in which the fishing vessel participates.
  (c) Fishery information
     The proposed information management system should, at a minimum, provide basic fisheries performance information for each fishery, including–
    (1) the number of vessels participating in the fishery including charter fishing vessels;
    (2) the time period in which the fishery occurs;
    (3) the approximate geographic location or official reporting area where the fishery occurs;
    (4) a description of fishing gear used in the fishery, including the amount and type of such gear and the appropriate unit of fishing effort; and
    (5) other information required under subsection \1\N 1853(a)(5) of this title or requested by the Council under section 1881a of this title.
  (d) Use of registration
     Any registration recommended under this section shall not be considered a permit for the purposes of this chapter, and the Secretary may not propose to revoke, suspend, deny, or impose any other conditions or restrictions on any such registration or the use of such registration under this chapter.
  (e) Public comment
     Within one year after October 11, 1996, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period a proposal that would provide for implementation of a standardized fishing vessel registration and information collection system that meets the requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section. The proposal shall include–
    (1) a description of the arrangements of the Secretary for consultation and cooperation with the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the States, the Councils, Marine Fisheries Commissions, the fishing industry and other interested parties; and
    (2) any proposed regulations or legislation necessary to implement the proposal.
  (f) Congressional transmittal
     Within 60 days after the end of the comment period and after consideration of comments received under subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives a recommended proposal for implementation of a national fishing vessel registration system that includes–
    (1) any modifications made after comment and consultation;
    (2) a proposed implementation schedule, including a schedule for the proposed cooperative agreements required under subsection (a)(4) of this section; and
    (3) recommendations for any such additional legislation as the Secretary considers necessary or desirable to implement the proposed system.
  (g) Report to Congress
     Within 15 months after October 11, 1996, the Secretary shall report to Congress on the need to include recreational fishing vessels into a national fishing vessel registration and information collection system. In preparing its report, the Secretary shall cooperate with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the States, the Councils, and Marine Fisheries Commissions, and consult with governmental and nongovernmental parties.
