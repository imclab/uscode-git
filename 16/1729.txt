    (1) Projects by qualified youth or conservation corps
       The Secretary is authorized to pay not more than 75 percent of the costs of any appropriate conservation project carried out pursuant to this subchapter on public lands by a qualified youth or conservation corps.

     In order to carry out the Public Lands Corps or to support resource assistants and qualified youth or conservation corps under this subchapter, the Secretary shall be eligible to apply for and receive assistance under section 121(b) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12571(b)].

     Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 1730 of this title are in addition to amounts allocated to the Public Lands Corps through other Federal programs or projects.
