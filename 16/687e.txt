  (a) Written notice of intention to remove; grounds
     The Administration may serve upon any director or officer of a licensee a written notice of its intention to remove him from office whenever, in the opinion of the Administration, such director or officer–
    (1) has willfully and knowingly committed any substantial violation of–
      (A) this chapter,
      (B) any regulation issued under this chapter, or
      (C) a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or
    (2) has willfully and knowingly committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice which constitutes a substantial breach of his fiduciary duty as such director or officer,
       and that such violation or such breach of fiduciary duty is one involving personal dishonesty on the part of such director or officer.
  (b) Suspension pending completion of administrative proceedings
     In respect to any director or officer referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Administration may, if it deems it necessary for the protection of the licensee or the interests of the Administration, by written notice to such effect served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall become effective upon service of such notice and, unless stayed by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served under subsection (a) of this section and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or, if an order of removal and/or prohibition is issued against the director or officer, until the effective date of any such order. Copies of any such notice shall also be served upon the interested licensee.
  (c) Hearing; order of removal
     A notice of intention to remove a director or officer, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds therefor, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Administration at the request of (1) such director or officer and for good cause shown, or (2) the Attorney General of the United States. Unless such director or officer shall appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of such removal. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Administration shall find that any of the grounds specified in such notice has been established, the Administration may issue such orders of removal from office as it deems appropriate. Any such order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after service upon such licensee and the director or officer concerned (except in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein). Such order shall remain effective and enforcible except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Administration or a reviewing court.
  (d) Stay by United States district court of suspension or prohibition
     Within ten days after any director or officer has been suspended from office and/or prohibited from participation in the conduct of the affairs of a licensee under subsection (b) of this section, such director or officer may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the licensee is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for a stay of such suspension and/or prohibition pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served upon such director or officer under subsection (a) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to stay such suspension and/or prohibition.
  (e) Suspension of directors and officers charged with felonies involving dishonesty or breach of trust; notice; duration of suspension; removal
     Whenever any director or officer of a licensee is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the Administration may, by written notice served upon such director or officer, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the licensee. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the licensee. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Administration. In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such offense is entered against such director or officer, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Administration may issue and serve upon such director or officer an order removing him from office. A copy of such order shall be served upon such licensee, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such licensee. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to suspend or remove such director or officer from office and/or to prohibit him from further participation in licensee affairs, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section.
  (f) Hearings; procedure; form and requisites of decision; review; stay of orders
    (1) Any hearing provided for in this section shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the principal office of the licensee is located unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, the Administration shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and cause to be served upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.
    (2) Any party to such proceeding may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the director or officer concerned, or an order issued under subsection (e) of this section), by filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the licensee is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Administration be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Administration, and thereupon the Administration shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall, except as provided in the last sentence of said paragraph (1), be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Administration. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
    (3) The commencement of proceedings for judicial review under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Administration.
