    (3) Technical assistance
       The Secretary shall provide owners with technical assistance to assist owners in complying with the terms of easements and restoration cost-share agreements.
  (c) Acceptability of offers
     In determining the acceptability of easement offers, the Secretary may take into consideration–

     In carrying out this subpart, to the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, the Secretary shall give priority to obtaining permanent conservation easements before shorter term conservation easements and, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall place priority on acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.
