        (i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and
        (ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.
      (B) Repurchase premium
        (i) In general
           For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the repurchase premium is the amount equal to the product of–
          (I) the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture on the date of prepayment; and
          (II) the applicable percentage rate, as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).
