      (B) The Secretary, in making appointments under this section, shall, to the extent practicable, ensure a fair and balanced apportionment, on a rotating or other basis, of the active participants (or their representatives) in the commercial and recreational fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council. On January 31, 1991, and each year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives a report on the actions taken by the Secretary to ensure that such fair and balanced apportionment is achieved.

        (iii) the geographic area in which the tribe of the representative is located.
      (C) A vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of any term shall be filled in the same manner as set out in subparagraphs (A) and (B), except that the Secretary may use the list from which the vacating representative was chosen.

Timely notice of each regular meeting shall also be published in the Federal Register. The published agenda of the meeting may not be modified to include additional matters for Council action without public notice or within 14 days prior to the meeting date, unless such modification is to address an emergency action under section 1855(c) of this title, in which case public notice shall be given immediately.

Interested parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to respond to new data or information before the Council takes final action on conservation and management measures.
      (j) Disclosure of financial interest and recusal
        (1) For the purposes of this subsection–
          (A) the term ””affected individual““ means an individual who–
            (i) is nominated by the Governor of a State for appointment as a voting member of a Council in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section; or
            (ii) is a voting member of a Council appointed–
              (I) under subsection (b)(2) of this section; or
              (II) under subsection (b)(5) of this section who is not subject to disclosure and recusal requirements under the laws of an Indian tribal government; and
          (B) the term ””designated official““ means a person with expertise in Federal conflict-of-interest requirements who is designated by the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, to attend Council meetings and make determinations under paragraph (7)(B).
        (2) Each affected individual must disclose any financial interest held by–
          (A) that individual;
          (B) the spouse, minor child, or partner of that individual; and
          (C) any organization (other than the Council) in which that individual is serving as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee;
             in any harvesting, processing, or marketing activity that is being, or will be, undertaken within any fishery over which the Council concerned has jurisdiction.
        (3) The disclosure required under paragraph (2) shall be made–
          (A) in the case of an affected individual referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), before appointment by the Secretary; and
          (B) in the case of an affected individual referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), within 45 days of taking office.
        (4) An affected individual referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) must update his or her disclosure form at any time any such financial interest is acquired, or substantially changed, by any person referred to in paragraph (2)(A), (B), or (C).

A Council decision shall be considered to have a significant and predictable effect on a financial interest if there is a close causal link between the Council decision and an expected and substantially disproportionate benefit to the financial interest of the affected individual relative to the financial interests of other participants in the same gear type or sector of the fishery. An affected individual who may not vote may participate in Council deliberations relating to the decision after notifying the Council of the voting recusal and identifying the financial interest that would be affected.
          (B) At the request of an affected individual, or upon the initiative of the appropriate designated official, the designated official shall make a determination for the record whether a Council decision would have a significant and predictable effect on a financial interest.

          (E) If the Council makes a decision before the Secretary has reviewed a determination under subparagraph (C), the eventual ruling may not be treated as cause for the invalidation or reconsideration by the Secretary of such decision.
          (F) The Secretary, in consultation with the Councils and by not later than one year from October 11, 1996, shall promulgate regulations which prohibit an affected individual from voting in accordance with subparagraph (A), and which allow for the making of determinations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
        (8) Section 208 of title 18 does not apply to an affected individual referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) during any time in which that individual is in compliance with the regulations prescribed under paragraph (5).
