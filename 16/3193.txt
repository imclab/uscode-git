  (b) Improved property on other units or areas established or expanded by this Act
     The following conditions shall apply regarding the construction, use and occupancy of cabins and related structures on Federal lands within conservation system units or areas not provided for in subsection (a) of this section:
    (1) The construction of new cabins is prohibited except as may be authorized pursuant to a nontransferable, five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed use, construction, and maintenance of a cabin is compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established and that the use of the cabin is either directly related to the administration of the unit or area or is necessary to provide for a continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the unit or area where the permit applicant has no reasonable alternative site for constructing a cabin. No special use permit shall be issued to authorize the construction of a cabin for private recreational use.
    (2) Traditional and customary uses of existing cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area may be allowed to continue in accordance with a nontransferable, renewable five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall be issued only upon a determination that the traditional and customary uses are compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established. No special use permits shall be issued to authorize the use of an existing cabin constructed for private recreational use.
    (3) No special use permit shall be issued under paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection unless the permit applicant:
      (A) In the case of existing cabins or structures, reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interests or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;
      (B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the existing or proposed cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;
      (C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove within a reasonable time period established by the Secretary, all personal property from it upon nonrenewal or revocation of the permit; and
      (D) Acknowledges in the permit application that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located or will be constructed.
    (4) The United States shall retain ownership of all new cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area specified in this subsection, and no proprietary rights or privileges shall be conveyed through the issuance of the special use permit authorized by paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection. Cabins or other structures not under permit shall be used only for official Government business: T3Provided, howeverK, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the unit or area manager, such cabins may be used by the general public.
  (c) Permits to be renewed for life of claimant and immediate family
    (1) Whenever issuance of a nontransferable renewable five-year special use permit is authorized by subsections (a) or (b) of this section, said permit shall be renewed every five years until the death of the last immediate family member of the claimant residing in the cabin or structure, or unless the Secretary has revoked the special use permit in accordance with the criteria established in this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary, after notice and hearing, may revoke a permit provided for in this section if he determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the administrative record as a whole, that the use under the permit is causing or may cause significant detriment to the principal purposes for which the unit was established.
  (d) Existing cabin leases or permits
     Nothing in this Act shall preclude the renewal or continuation of valid leases or permits in effect on December 2, 1980, for cabins, homesites, or similar structures on Federal lands. Unless the Secretary, or in the case of national forest lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, issues specific findings following notice and an opportunity for the lease-holder or permittee to respond, that renewal or continuation of such valid permit or lease constitutes a direct threat to or a significant impairment to the purposes for which a conservation system unit was established (in the case of a structure located within a conservation system unit) or the public domain or national forest (in case of a structure located outside conservation system units), he shall renew such valid leases or permits upon their expiration in accordance with the provisions of the original lease or permit, subject to such reasonable regulations as he may prescribe. Subject to the provisions of the original lease or permit, nothing in this Act or subsection shall necessarily preclude the appropriate Secretary from transferring such a lease or permit to another person at the election or death of the original permittee or leasee.
