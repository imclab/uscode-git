  (d) Conditions having permission of effectiveness
     If the requirements of subsections (c) and (g) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall permit a declaration regarding the issue or sale of a security to become effective unless the Commission finds that–

    (2) the security is not reasonably adapted to the earning power of the declarant;
    (3) financing by the issue and sale of the particular security is not necessary or appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of a business in which the applicant lawfully is engaged or has an interest;

    (5) in the case of a security that is a guaranty of, or assumption of liability on, a security of another company, the circumstances are such as to constitute the making of such guaranty or the assumption of such liability an improper risk for the declarant; or

     Any order permitting a declaration to become effective may contain such terms and conditions as the Commission finds necessary to assure compliance with the conditions specified in this section.
