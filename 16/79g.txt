  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to contracts for the acquisition of land and interests in land for the purposes of this subchapter as was given the Secretary of the Treasury for other land acquisitions by section 261 of title 40, and the Secretary and the owner of land to be acquired under this subchapter may agree that the purchase price will be paid in periodic installments over a period that does not exceed ten years, with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at a rate which is not in excess of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on the installments.
  (b) Judgments against the United States, including final partial judgments and compromise settlements of claims referred to the Attorney General for defense of suits against the United States, for amounts in excess of the deposit in court in actions under section 79c of this title shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of section 1304 of title 31, and section 2414 of title 28. Final partial judgments and compromise settlements are payable only after certification by the Attorney General to the Comptroller General that it is in the interest of the United States to do so.
