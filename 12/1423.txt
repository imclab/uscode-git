   As soon as practicable the Board shall divide the continental United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii into not less than eight nor more than twelve districts. Such districts shall be apportioned with due regard to the convenience and customary course of business of the institutions eligible to and likely to subscribe for stock of a Federal Home Loan Bank to be formed under this chapter, but no such district shall contain a fractional part of any State. The districts thus created may be readjusted and new districts may from time to time be created by the Board, not to exceed twelve in all. Such districts shall be known as Federal Home Loan Bank districts and may be designated by number. As soon as practicable the Board shall establish, in each district, a Federal Home Loan Bank at such city as may be designated by the Board. Its title shall include the name of the city at which it is established.
