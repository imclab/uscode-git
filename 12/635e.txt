  (b) Presidential determination
    (1) In general
       Not later than March 31 of each fiscal year, the President of the United States shall determine whether the authority available to the Bank for such fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the Bank“s needs, particularly those needs arising from–
      (A) increases in the level of exports unforeseen at the time of the original budget request for such fiscal year;
      (B) any increased foreign export credit subsidies; or
      (C) the lack of progress in negotiations to reduce or eliminate export credit subsidies.
    (2) Report
       Not later than April 15 of each year, the President of the United States shall transmit to the Congress a report on such determination.
    (3) Request for legislation
      (A) In general
         If the President of the United States finds that the amount of direct loan authority or guarantee authority available to the Bank for the fiscal year involved exceeds the amount which will be necessary to carry out the Bank“s functions consistent with the availability of qualified applications and limitations imposed by law during such year, the President of the United States shall promptly transmit to the Congress a request for legislation to eliminate the amount of such excess direct loan, loan guarantee, or insurance authority.
      (B) Continued availability of authority
         The Bank shall continue to make remaining amounts of its authority available for the fiscal year involved, in accordance with its practices and the requirements of this subchapter, unless otherwise directed pursuant to law.
