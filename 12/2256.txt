   Any organization other than State banks, trust companies, and savings associations shall, as a condition precedent to securing discount privileges with a bank of the Farm Credit System, file with such bank its written consent to examination by farm credit examiners as may be directed by the Farm Credit Administration; and State banks, trust companies, and savings associations may be required in like manner to file a written consent that reports of their examination by constituted State authorities may be furnished by such authorities upon the request of the Farm Credit Administration.
