  (a) In general
     In connection with its examination of a financial institution, the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency shall–
    (1) assess the institution“s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution; and
    (2) take such record into account in its evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by such institution.
  (b) Majority-owned institutions
     In assessing and taking into account, under subsection (a) of this section, the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned financial institution, the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency may consider as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the institution in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions provided that these activities help meet the credit needs of local communities in which such institutions and credit unions are chartered.
