   A national banking association may deal in, underwrite, and purchase for such association“s own account qualified Canadian government obligations to the same extent that such association may deal in, underwrite, and purchase for such association“s own account obligations of the United States or general obligations of any State or of any political subdivision thereof. For purposes of this paragraph–
  (1) the term ””qualified Canadian government obligations““ means any debt obligation which is backed by Canada, any Province of Canada, or any political subdivision of any such Province to a degree which is comparable to the liability of the United States, any State, or any political subdivision thereof for any obligation which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, such State, or such political subdivision, and such term includes any debt obligation of any agent of Canada or any such Province or any political subdivision of such Province if–
    (A) the obligation of the agent is assumed in such agent“s capacity as agent for Canada or such Province or such political subdivision; and
    (B) Canada, such Province, or such political subdivision on whose behalf such agent is acting with respect to such obligation is ultimately and unconditionally liable for such obligation; and
  (2) the term ””Province of Canada““ means a Province of Canada and includes the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories and their successors.

     Eighth. To contribute to community funds, or to charitable, philanthropic, or benevolent instrumentalities conducive to public welfare, such sums as its board of directors may deem expedient and in the interests of the association, if it is located in a State the laws of which do not expressly prohibit State banking institutions from contributing to such funds or instrumentalities.
     Ninth. To issue and sell securities which are guaranteed pursuant to section 1721(g) of this title.
     Tenth. To invest in tangible personal property, including, without limitation, vehicles, manufactured homes, machinery, equipment, or furniture, for lease financing transactions on a net lease basis, but such investment may not exceed 10 percent of the assets of the association.
     Eleventh. To make investments designed primarily to promote the public welfare, including the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families (such as by providing housing, services, or jobs). A national banking association may make such investments directly or by purchasing interests in an entity primarily engaged in making such investments. An association shall not make any such investment if the investment would expose the association to unlimited liability. The Comptroller of the Currency shall limit an association“s investments in any 1 project and an association“s aggregate investments under this paragraph. An association“s aggregate investments under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum of 5 percent of the association“s capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and 5 percent of the association“s unimpaired surplus fund, unless the Comptroller determines by order that the higher amount will pose no significant risk to the affected deposit insurance fund, and the association is adequately capitalized. In no case shall an association“s aggregate investments under this paragraph exceed an amount equal to the sum of 10 percent of the association“s capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and 10 percent of the association“s unimpaired surplus fund.
