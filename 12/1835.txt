     With respect to the transfer of a small business loan or lease of personal property with recourse that is a sale under generally accepted accounting principles, each qualified insured depository institution shall–

    (2) such greater amount, as established by the appropriate Federal banking agency by regulation or order.
  (e) Institutions that cease to be qualified or exceed aggregate limits
     If an insured depository institution ceases to be a qualified insured depository institution or exceeds the limits under subsection (d) of this section, this section shall remain applicable to any transfers of small business loans or leases of personal property that occurred during the time that the institution was qualified and did not exceed such limit.
  (f) Prompt corrective action not affected

    (2) Existing transactions not affected
