    (1) any alternative mortgage transaction undertaken on or after such date pursuant to an agreement to undertake such alternative mortgage transaction which was entered into on or after October 15, 1982, and prior to such later date (the ””preemption period““); and  
    (2) any renewal, extension, refinancing, or other modification of an alternative mortgage transaction that was entered into during the preemption period.  
  (b) An alternative mortgage transaction shall be deemed to have been undertaken during the preemption period to which this section applies if it–  
    (1) is funded or extended in whole or in part during the preemption period, regardless of whether pursuant to a commitment or other agreement therefor made prior to that period; or  
    (2) is a renewal, extension, refinancing, or other modification of an alternative mortgage transaction entered into before the preemption period and such renewal, extension, or other modification is made during such period with the written consent of any person obligated to repay such credit.
