   The Farm Credit Administration is authorized to create in any of the twelve farm credit districts where it may deem the same to be desirable a regional agricultural credit corporation with a paid-up capital of not less than $3,000,000, to be subscribed for by the Farm Credit Administration and paid for out of the unexpended balance of the amounts allocated and made available to the Secretary of Agriculture under section 2 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act. Such corporations shall be managed by officers and agents to be appointed by the Farm Credit Administration under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe. Such corporations are authorized and empowered to make loans or advances to farmers and stockmen, the proceeds of which are to be used for an agricultural purpose (including crop production), or for the raising, breeding, fattening, or marketing of livestock, to charge such rates of interest or discount thereon as in their judgment are fair and equitable, subject to the approval of the Farm Credit Administration, and to rediscount with the Farm Credit Administration and the various Federal reserve banks and Federal intermediate credit banks any paper that they acquire which is eligible for such purpose. All expenses incurred in connection with the operation of such corporations shall be supervised and paid by the Farm Credit Administration under such rules and regulations as its board of directors may prescribe.
