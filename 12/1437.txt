No dividends shall be paid except out of net earnings remaining after reductions for all reserves, chargeoffs, purchases of capital certificates of the Financing Corporation, and payments relating to the Funding Corporation required under this chapter have been provided for, other than chargeoffs or expenses incurred by a Bank in connection with the purchase of capital stock of the Financing Corporation under section 1441 of this title or payments relating to the Funding Corporation Principal Fund under section 1441b(e) of this title, and then only with the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Board. Beginning on January 1, 1992, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting ””previously retained earnings or current net earnings““ for ””net earnings““.
