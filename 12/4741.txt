  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds that–
    (1) small business concerns are a vital part of the economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, and new services created in the United States;
    (2) adequate access to debt capital is a critical component for small business development, productivity, expansion, and success in the United States;
    (3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;
    (4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small business concerns;
    (5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;
    (6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;
    (7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and
    (8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small business capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.
  (b) Purposes
     By encouraging States to implement administratively efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subchapter are–
    (1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;
    (2) to create jobs;
    (3) to promote economic efficiency;
    (4) to enhance productivity; and
    (5) to spur innovation.
