   The Board of Directors shall adopt and publish its own conflict of interest rules which shall be no less stringent in effect than the Federal Executive conflict of interest rules contained in Executive Order Numbered 11222 in prohibiting participation or action or the use of inside information for personal advantage on any matter involving a corporation, trust, partnership, or cooperative organization in which a board member, officer, or employee holds a substantial financial interest or holds a position as board member or senior officer, the activities of which organization might be relevant to, be competitive with, or be inconsistent with the objectives of any bank created under this chapter. These rules shall requireâ€“
  (1) each nominee for elected membership on the Board established under this chapter to make public and file with the election official before the date of election a statement of his financial interest and position, if any, in such organizations; and
  (2) each senior executive officer and appointed member of the Board to file with the appointing officer, before entering that office a statement of his financial interest and position, if any, in such organizations, which shall be available for inspection upon request.
