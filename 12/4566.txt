    (2) Guidelines
       The Secretary shall establish guidelines to measure the extent of compliance with the housing goals, which may assign full credit, partial credit, or no credit toward achievement of the housing goals to different categories of mortgage purchase activities of the enterprises, based on such criteria as the Secretary deems appropriate.
    (3) Extent of compliance
       In determining compliance with the housing goals established under this subpart, the Secretary–

  (b) Notice and determination of failure to meet goals
    (1) Notice
       If the Secretary determines that an enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that an enterprise will fail, to meet any housing goal established under section 4562, 4563, or 4564 of this title, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the enterprise of such a determination, the reasons for such determination, the requirement to submit a housing plan under subsection (c) of this section, and the information on which the Secretary based the determination or imposed such requirement.
    (2) Response period
      (A) In general
         During the 30-day period beginning on the date that an enterprise is provided notice under paragraph (1), the enterprise may submit to the Secretary any written information that the enterprise considers appropriate for consideration by the Secretary in determining whether such failure has occurred or whether the achievement of such goal was or is feasible.
      (B) Extended period
         The Secretary may extend the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause for not more than 30 additional days.
      (C) Shortened period
         The Secretary may shorten the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause.
      (D) Failure to respond

    (3) Consideration of information and determination
      (A) In general
         After the expiration of the response period under paragraph (2) or upon receipt of information provided during such period by the enterprise, whichever occurs earlier, the Secretary shall determine (i) whether the enterprise has failed, or there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet the housing goal, and (ii) whether (taking into consideration market and economic conditions and the financial condition of the enterprise) the achievement of the housing goal was or is feasible.
      (B) Considerations
         In making such determinations, the Secretary shall take into consideration any relevant information submitted by the enterprise during the response period.
      (C) Notice

    (2) Contents
       Each housing plan shall be a feasible plan describing the specific actions the enterprise will take–
      (A) to achieve the goal for the next calendar year; or
      (B) if the Secretary determines that there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail to meet a goal in the current year, to make such improvements as are reasonable in the remainder of such year.
       The plan shall be sufficiently specific to enable the Secretary to monitor compliance periodically.
    (3) Deadline for submission
       The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a deadline for an enterprise to submit a housing plan to the Secretary, which may not be more than 45 days after the enterprise is provided notice under subsection (b)(3) of this section that a housing plan is required.
