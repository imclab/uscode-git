  (a) Whenever the Farm Credit Administration shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the institution or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution under section 2261 of this title, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the institution, or is likely to seriously weaken the condition of the institution or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or shareholders in the institution prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted under section 2261 of this title, the Farm Credit Administration may issue a temporary order requiring the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (b) of this section, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Farm Credit Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease and desist order is issued against the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person, until effective date of such order.
  (b) Within ten days after the institution concerned or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution has been served with a temporary cease and desist order, the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the institution is located, or the United States district court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person under section 2261 of this title, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.
