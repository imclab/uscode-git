     No insured depository institution, insured branch of a foreign bank, or mutual savings or cooperative bank which is not an insured depository institution, shall make any federally related mortgage loan to any agent, trustee, nominee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity without the prior condition that the identity of the person receiving the beneficial interest of such loan shall at all times be revealed to the insured depository institution, insured branch, or bank. At the request of the Corporation, the insured depository institution, insured branch, or bank shall report to the Corporation on the identity of such person and the nature and amount of the loan, discount, or other extension of credit.
  (b) Enforcement; bank status
     In addition to other available remedies, this section may be enforced with respect to mutual savings and cooperative banks which are not insured depository institutions in accordance with section 1818 of this title, and for such purpose such mutual savings and cooperative banks shall be held and considered to be State nonmember insured banks and the appropriate Federal agency with respect to such mutual savings and cooperative banks shall be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
