    (3) due to the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with (A) residuals of organic disease or injury, or (B) the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity, which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair,
       in acquiring a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the veteran“s disability, and necessary land therefor. The regulations of the Secretary shall include, but not be limited to, provisions requiring findings that (1) it is medically feasible for such veteran to reside in the proposed housing unit and in the proposed locality; (2) the proposed housing unit bears a proper relation to the veteran“s present and anticipated income and expenses; and (3) the nature and condition of the proposed housing unit are such as to be suitable to the veteran“s needs for dwelling purposes.

      (A) is due to blindness in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or
      (B) includes the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands,
         in acquiring such adaptations to such veteran“s residence as are determined by the Secretary to be reasonably necessary because of such disability or in acquiring a residence already adapted with special features determined by the Secretary to be reasonably necessary for the veteran because of such disability.
    (2) Assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection may be provided only to a veteran who the Secretary determines is residing in and reasonably intends to continue residing in a residence owned by such veteran or by a member of such veteran“s family or, if the veteran“s residence is to be constructed or purchased, will be residing in and reasonably intends to continue residing in a residence owned by such veteran or by a member of such veteran“s family.
