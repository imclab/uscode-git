    (2)      (A) The amount needed by a veteran to pursue a program of education at an institution for any academic year shall be determined by subtracting (i) the total amount of financial resources (as defined in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) available to the veteran which may be reasonably expected to be expended by such veteran for educational purposes in any year from (ii) the actual cost of attendance (as defined in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) at the institution in which such veteran is enrolled.

    (3) shall provide that the loan shall bear interest, on the unpaid balance of the loan, at a rate prescribed by the Secretary, at the time the loan is contracted for which rate shall be comparable to the rate of interest charged students at such time on loans insured by the Secretary of Education under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, but in no event shall the rate so prescribed by the Secretary exceed the rate charged students on such insured loans, and shall provide that no interest shall accrue prior to the beginning date of repayment; and
    (4) shall provide that the loan shall be made without security and without endorsement.
  (e)    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever the Secretary determines that a default has occurred on any loan made under this subchapter, the Secretary shall declare an overpayment, and such overpayment shall be recovered from the veteran concerned in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.

Criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i) of the preceding sentence may include a minimum amount of tuition and fees that an eligible veteran may pay in order to be eligible for such a loan (except that any such criterion shall not apply with respect to a loan for which the veteran is eligible as a result of an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran for loans under this section provided for by section 3462(a)(2) of this title).
      (B) In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration information developed in the course of the review required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.
