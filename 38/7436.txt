  (a) Subject to section 7431(e) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, special pay under this subchapter for dentists employed on a part-time basis shall be based on the special-pay factors and annual rates specified in section 7435 of this title.
  (b) The annual rate of special pay paid to a dentist employed on a part-time basis shall bear the same ratio to the annual rate that the dentist would be paid under section 7435 of this title (other than for full-time status) if the dentist were employed on a full-time basis as the amount of part-time employment by the dentist bears to full-time employment, except that such ratio may not exceed 3/4.
