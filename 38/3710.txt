      (A) the guaranty that would be provided under those provisions for the dwelling without the energy efficiency improvements; and
      (B) an amount that bears the same relation to the cost of the energy efficiency improvements as the guaranty referred to in subparagraph (A) bears to the amount of the loan minus the cost of such improvements.

    (2) For the purpose of determining whether a veteran meets the standards referred to in subsection (b)(3) of this section and section 3712(e)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which establish–
