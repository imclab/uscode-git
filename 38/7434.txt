  (a) Subject to section 7431(e) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, special pay under this subchapter for physicians employed on a part-time basis shall be based on the special-pay factors and annual rates specified in section 7433 of this title.
  (b) The annual rate of special pay paid to a physician employed on a part-time basis shall bear the same ratio to the annual rate that the physician would be paid under section 7433 (other than for full-time status) if the physician were employed on a full-time basis as the amount of part-time employment by the physician bears to full-time employment, except that such ratio may not exceed 3/4.
