Each such determination shall be in writing.
    (2) If the determination of the performance review panel in any case is that the member“s job performance as a member of the Board meets the performance standards for a member of the Board established under subsection (f), the Chairman shall recertify the member“s appointment as a member of the Board.

      (B) recommend to the Secretary that the member be noncertified.
