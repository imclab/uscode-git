    (5) reasonable assurance that title to such site is or will be vested solely in the applicant, a State home, or another agency or instrumentality of the State,
    (6) reasonable assurance that adequate financial support will be available for the construction of the project (or for facility acquisition and construction of the project) by July 1 of the fiscal year for which the application is approved and for its maintenance and operation when complete,

    (9) in the case of a project for acquisition of a facility, reasonable assurance that the estimated total cost of acquisition of the facility and of any expansion, remodeling, and alteration of the acquired facility will not be greater than the estimated cost of construction of an equivalent new facility.
  (b)    (1) Upon receipt of an application for a grant under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary–
      (A) shall determine whether the application meets the requirements of this section and of the regulations prescribed under section 8134 of this title;
      (B) shall notify the State submitting the application whether the application conforms with those requirements and, if it does not, of the actions necessary to bring the application into conformance with those requirements; and
      (C) shall determine the priority of the project described in the application in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
    (2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (5)(C) of this subsection, the Secretary shall accord priority to applications in the following order:
      (A) An application from a State that has made sufficient funds available for the construction or acquisition of the project for which the grant is requested so that such project may proceed upon approval of the grant without further action required by the State to make such funds available for such purpose.
      (B) An application from a State that does not have a State home facility constructed or acquired with assistance under this subchapter (or for which such a grant has been made).
      (C) An application from a State which the Secretary determines, in accordance with criteria and procedures specified in regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, has a greater need for nursing home or domiciliary beds or adult day health care facilities than other States from which applications are received.
      (D) An application that meets such other criteria as the Secretary determines are appropriate and has established in regulations.
    (3) In according priorities to projects under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary–
      (A) shall accord priority only to projects which would involve construction or acquisition of either nursing home or domiciliary buildings or construction (other than new construction) of adult day health care buildings; and
      (B) may not accord any priority to a project which would expand a State“s capacity to furnish hospital care in a State home.
    (4) The Secretary shall establish a list of approved projects (including projects that have been conditionally approved under paragraph (6) of this subsection), in the order of their priority, as of August 15 of each year. The Secretary shall award grants in the order of their priority on the list during the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the calendar year in which the list was made.
    (5)      (A) The Secretary shall defer approval of an application that otherwise meets the requirements of this section if the State submitting the application does not, by the July 1 deadline (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph), demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has provided adequate financial support for construction of the project.
      (B) In a case in which approval of an application is deferred under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall select for award of a grant or grants under this subsection an application or applications which would not have been approved during the fiscal year but for the deferral and to which the Secretary accords the highest priority under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
      (C) An application deferred in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph shall be accorded priority in any subsequent fiscal year ahead of applications that had not been approved before the first day of the fiscal year in which the deferred application was first approved.
      (D) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ””July 1 deadline““ means July 1 of the fiscal year in which the State is notified by the Secretary of the availability of funding for a grant for such project.
    (6)      (A) The Secretary may conditionally approve a project under this section, conditionally award a grant for the project, and obligate funds for the grant if the Secretary determines that the application for the grant is sufficiently complete to warrant awarding the grant and that, based on assurances provided by the State submitting the application, the State will complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection by the date, not later than 180 days after the date of the conditional approval, specified by the Secretary.
      (B) If a State does not complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in such paragraph by the date specified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall rescind the conditional approval and award under such subparagraph and deobligate the funds previously obligated in connection with the application. In the event the Secretary rescinds conditional approval of a project under this subparagraph, the Secretary may not further obligate funds for the project during the fiscal year in which the Secretary rescinds such approval.
    (7)      (A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary may increase the amount of any grant awarded to any State for a project under this section by an amount by which the Secretary determines that the estimated cost of the construction or acquisition has increased from the estimated cost on which the Secretary based the determination to award the grant, without regard to the position of such project on the list established under paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the Secretary determines that the grant was awarded before the State entered into a contract for the construction or acquisition provided for in such project.
      (B) A grant may not be increased under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by more than 10 percent of the amount of the grant initially awarded for such project, and the amount of such grant, as increased, may not exceed 65 percent of the cost of the project.
  (c) No application submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be disapproved until the Secretary has afforded the applicant notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

Such amount shall be paid, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments consistent with the progress of the project as the Secretary may determine and certify for payment to the Secretary of the Treasury. Funds paid under this section for an approved project shall be used solely for carrying out such project as so approved.
  (e) Any amendment of any application, whether or not approved, shall be subject to approval in the same manner as an original application.
