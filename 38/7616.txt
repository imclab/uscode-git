  (a) Each participant in the Scholarship Program shall provide service as a full-time employee of the Department for the period of obligated service provided in the agreement of the participant entered into under section 7603 of this title. Such service shall be provided in the full-time clinical practice of such participant“s profession or in another health-care position in an assignment or location determined by the Secretary.
  (b)    (1) Not later than 60 days before the participant“s service commencement date, the Secretary shall notify the participant of that service commencement date. That date is the date for the beginning of the participant“s period of obligated service.
    (2) As soon as possible after the participant“s service commencement date, the Secretary shall–
      (A) in the case of a participant who is not a full-time employee in the Veterans Health Administration, appoint such participant as such an employee; and

However, the Secretary may, at the request of such participant, defer such date until the end of the period of time required for the participant to complete an internship or residency or other advanced clinical training. If the participant requests such a deferral, the Secretary shall notify the participant that such deferral could lead to an additional period of obligated service in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection.
        (ii) No such period of internship or residency or other advanced clinical training shall be counted toward satisfying a period of obligated service under this subchapter.

Such a participant may, at the discretion of the Secretary and upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, incur an additional period of obligated service–
      (A) at the rate of one-half of a calendar year for each year of internship or residency or other advanced clinical training (or a proportionate ratio thereof), if the internship, residency, or advanced clinical training is in a medical specialty necessary to meet the health-care requirements of the Department (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary); or
      (B) at the rate of three-quarters of a calendar year for each year of internship or residency or other advanced clinical training (or a proportionate ratio thereof), if the internship, residency, or advanced clinical training is not in a medical specialty necessary to meet the health-care requirements of the Department (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary).
    (5) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the service commencement date for participants who were part-time students. Such regulations shall prescribe terms as similar as practicable to the terms set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection.
  (c)    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a participant in the Scholarship Program shall be considered to have begun serving such participant“s period of obligated service–

    (2) A participant in the Scholarship Program who on such participant“s course completion date is a full-time employee in the Veterans Health Administration serving in a capacity for which such participant“s course of training prepared such participant shall be considered to have begun serving such participant“s period of obligated service on such course completion date.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the term ””course completion date““ means the date on which a participant in the Scholarship Program completes such participant“s course of education or training under the program.
