  (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, with respect to matters arising by reason of this chapter, the Secretary may–
    (1) sue and be sued in the Secretary“s official capacity in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal, but nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorizing garnishment or attachment against the Secretary, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any of its employees;
    (2) subject to specific limitations in this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest or any portion thereof, security or other provisions of any note, contract, mortgage or other instrument securing a loan which has been guaranteed, insured, made or acquired under this chapter;
    (3) pay, or compromise, any claim on, or arising because of, any such guaranty or insurance;
    (4) pay, compromise, waive or release any right, title, claim, lien or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption;
    (5) purchase at any sale, public or private, upon such terms and for such prices as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, and take title to, property, real, personal or mixed; and similarly sell, at public or private sale, exchange, assign, convey, or otherwise dispose of any such property; and
    (6) complete, administer, operate, obtain and pay for insurance on, and maintain, renovate, repair, modernize, lease, or otherwise deal with any property acquired or held pursuant to this chapter. The acquisition of any such property shall not deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil or criminal jurisdiction of, on, or over such property (including power to tax) or impair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property. Without regard to section 3302(b) of title 31 or any other provision of law not expressly in limitation of this paragraph, the Secretary may permit brokers utilized by the Secretary in connection with such properties to deduct from rental collections amounts covering authorized fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the management, repair, sale, or lease of any such properties and remit the net balances to the Secretary.
  (b) The powers granted by this section may be exercised by the Secretary without regard to any other provision of law not enacted expressly in limitation of this section, which otherwise would govern the expenditure of public funds; however, section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) shall apply to any contract for services or supplies on account of any property acquired pursuant to this section if the amount of such contract exceeds the amount prescribed in clause (1) of the first sentence of such section.
  (c) The financial transactions of the Secretary incident to, or arising out of, the guaranty or insurance of loans pursuant to this chapter, and the acquisition, management, and disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, incident to such activities and pursuant to this section, shall be final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government.
  (d) The right to redeem provided for by section 2410(c) of title 28 shall not arise in any case in which the subordinate lien or interest of the United States derives from a guaranteed or insured loan.
  (e)    (1) The Secretary is authorized from time to time, as the Secretary determines advisable, to set aside first mortgage loans, and installment sale contracts, owned and held by the Secretary under this chapter as the basis for the sale of participation certificates as herein provided. For this purpose the Secretary may enter into agreements, including trust agreements, with the Government National Mortgage Association, and any other Federal agency, under which the Association as fiduciary may sell certificates of participation based on principal and interest collections to be received by the Secretary and the Association or any other such agency on first mortgage loans and installment sale contracts comprising mortgage pools established by them. The agreement may provide for substitution or withdrawal of mortgage loans, or installment sale contracts, or for substitution of cash for mortgages in the pool. The agreement shall provide that the Government National Mortgage Association shall promptly pay to the Secretary the entire proceeds of any sale of certificates of participation to the extent such certificates are based on mortgages, including installment sale contracts, set aside by the Secretary and the Secretary shall periodically pay to the Association, as fiduciary, such funds as are required for payment of interest and principal due on outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the pro rata amount allocated to the Secretary pursuant to the agreement. The agreement shall also provide that the Secretary shall retain ownership of mortgage loans and installment sale contracts set aside by the Secretary pursuant to the agreement unless transfer of ownership to the fiduciary is required in the event of default or probable default in the payment of participation certificates. The Secretary is authorized to purchase outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the amount of the Secretary“s commitment to the fiduciary on participations outstanding and to pay the Secretary“s proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Government National Mortgage Association as fiduciary pursuant to the agreement.
    (2) The Secretary shall proportionately allocate and deposit the entire proceeds received from the sale of participations into the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter, as determined on an estimated basis, and the amounts so deposited shall be available for the purposes of the funds. The Secretary may nevertheless make such allocations of that part of the proceeds of participation sales representing anticipated interest collections on mortgage loans, including installment sale contracts, on other than an estimated proportionate basis if determined necessary to assure payment of interest on advances theretofore made to the Secretary by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes. The Secretary shall set aside and maintain necessary reserves in the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter to be used for meeting commitments pursuant to this subsection and, as the Secretary determines to be necessary, for meeting interest payments on advances by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes.
  (f) Whenever loss, destruction, or damage to any residential property securing loans guaranteed, insured, made, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter occurs as the result of a major disaster as determined by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), the Secretary shall (1) provide counseling and such other service to the owner of such property as may be feasible and shall inform such owner concerning the disaster assistance available from other Federal agencies and from State or local agencies, and (2) pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, extend on an individual case basis such forebearance or indulgence to such owner as the Secretary determines to be warranted by the facts of the case and the circumstances of such owner.
  (g) The Secretary shall, at the request of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and without reimbursement, certify to such Secretary whether an applicant for assistance under any law administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is a veteran.
  (h)    (1) The Secretary may, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, issue or approve the issuance of, and guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgage loans made in connection with the sale of properties acquired under this chapter.
    (2) The Secretary may not under this subsection guarantee the payment of principal and interest on certificates or other securities issued or approved after December 31, 1995.
