  (a)    (1) The United States has an obligation to assist veterans of the Armed Forces in readjusting to civilian life since veterans, by virtue of their military service, have lost opportunities to pursue education and training oriented toward civilian careers. The Federal Government is also continuously concerned with building an effective work force, and veterans constitute a major recruiting source. It is, therefore, the policy of the United States and the purpose of this section to promote the maximum of employment and job advancement opportunities within the Federal Government for disabled veterans and certain veterans of the Vietnam era and of the post-Vietnam era who are qualified for such employment and advancement.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the term ””agency““ means a department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch.

      (A) such an appointment may be made up to and including the level GS–11 or its equivalent;
      (B) a veteran shall be eligible for such an appointment without regard to the number of years of education completed by such veteran;
      (C) a veteran who is entitled to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whose discharge or release from active duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty shall be given a preference for such an appointment over other veterans;
      (D) a veteran receiving such an appointment shall–
        (i) in the case of a veteran with less than 15 years of education, receive training or education; and
        (ii) upon successful completion of the prescribed probationary period, acquire a competitive status; and
      (E) a veteran given an appointment under the authority of this subsection whose employment under the appointment is terminated within one year after the date of such appointment shall have the same right to appeal that termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment.
    (2) This subsection applies to–
      (A) a veteran of the Vietnam era; and
      (B) veterans who first became a member of the Armed Forces or first entered on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces after May 7, 1975, and were discharged or released from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable.
    (3)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, a veteran of the Vietnam era may receive an appointment under this section only during the period ending–

      (D) For purposes of clause (i) of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from active duty of less than ninety days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title or of an involuntary separation described in section 3018A(a)(1).
  (c) Each agency shall include in its affirmative action plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement of handicapped individuals in such agency as required by section 501(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791(b)), a separate specification of plans (in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe in consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, consistent with the purposes, provisions, and priorities of such Act) to promote and carry out such affirmative action with respect to disabled veterans in order to achieve the purpose of this section.
