  (a) Any policy of insurance purchased by the Secretary under section 1966 of this title shall automatically insure against death–
    (1) any member of a uniformed service on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority;
    (2) any member of the Ready Reserve of a uniformed service who meets the qualifications set forth in section 1965(5)(B) of this title;
    (3) any member assigned to, or who upon application would be eligible for assignment to, the Retired Reserve of a uniformed service who meets the qualifications set forth in section 1965(5)(C) of this title; and
    (4) any member assigned to the Retired Reserve of a uniform service who meets the qualifications set forth in section 1965(5)(D) of this title;
       in the amount of $100,000, unless such member elects in writing (A) not to be insured under this subchapter, or (B) to be insured in an amount less than $100,000 that is evenly divisible by $10,000. The insurance shall be effective the first day of active duty or active duty for training, or the beginning of a period of inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority, or the first day a member of the Ready Reserve meets the qualifications set forth in section 1965(5)(B) of this title, or the first day a member of the Reserves, whether or not assigned to the Retired Reserve of a uniformed service, meets the qualifications of section 1965(5)(C) of this title, or the first day a member of the Reserves meets the qualifications of section 1965(5)(D) of this title, or the date certified by the Secretary to the Secretary concerned as the date Servicemen“s Group Life Insurance under this subchapter for the class or group concerned takes effect, whichever is the later date.
  (b) Any member (other than one who has elected not to be insured under this subchapter for the period or periods of duty involved)–
    (1) who, when authorized or required by competent authority, assumes an obligation to perform (for less than thirty-one days) active duty, or active duty for training, or inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority; and
    (2) who is rendered uninsurable at standard premium rates according to the good health standards approved by the Secretary, or dies within one hundred and twenty days thereafter, from a disability, or aggravation of a preexisting disability, incurred by such member while proceeding directly to or returning directly from such active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training as the case may be;
       shall be deemed to have been on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, as the case may be, and to have been insured under this subchapter at the time such disability was incurred or aggravated, and if death occurs within one hundred and twenty days thereafter as a result of such disability to have been insured at the time of death. In determining whether or not such individual was so authorized or required to perform such duty, and whether or not such member was rendered uninsurable or died within one hundred and twenty days thereafter from a disability so incurred or aggravated, there shall be taken into account the call or order to duty, the orders and authorizations of competent authority, the hour on which the member began to so proceed or to return, the hour on which such member was scheduled to arrive for, or on which such member ceased to perform such duty; the method of travel employed; such member“s itinerary; the manner in which the travel was performed; and the immediate cause of disability or death. Whenever any claim is filed alleging that the claimant is entitled to benefits by reason of this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the claimant.
  (c) If any member elects not to be insured under this subchapter or to be insured in any amount less than $100,000, such member may thereafter be insured under this subchapter in the amount of $100,000 or any lesser amount evenly divisible by $10,000 upon written application, proof of good health, and compliance with such other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Any former member insured under Veterans“ Group Life Insurance who again becomes eligible for Servicemen“s Group Life Insurance and declines such coverage solely for the purpose of maintaining such member“s Veterans“ Group Life Insurance in effect shall upon termination of coverage under Veterans“ Group Life Insurance be automatically insured under Servicemen“s Group Life Insurance, if otherwise eligible therefor.

    (1) the member–
      (A) is insured under this subchapter on May 1, 1991; or
      (B) within one year after May 1, 1991, reinstates insurance under this subchapter that had lapsed for nonpayment of premiums; and
    (2) the member submits a written application for the increased coverage to the office established pursuant to section 1966(b) of this title within one year after May 1, 1991.
  (e) In addition to the amounts of insurance otherwise provided under this section, an eligible member may, upon application, obtain increased coverage beyond that provided under this section in the amount of $100,000, or any lesser amount evenly divisible by $10,000.
  (f) The effective date and time for any change in benefits under the Servicemen“s Group Life Insurance Program shall be based on the date and time according to the time zone immediately west of the International Date Line.
