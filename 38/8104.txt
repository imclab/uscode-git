    (2) No funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year, and the Secretary may not obligate or expend funds (other than for advance planning and design), for any major medical facility project or any major medical facility lease unless funds for that project or lease have been specifically authorized by law.
    (3) For the purpose of this subsection:
      (A) The term ””major medical facility project““ means a project for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility involving a total expenditure of more than $3,000,000, but such term does not include an acquisition by exchange.
      (B) The term ””major medical facility lease““ means a lease for space for use as a new medical facility at an average annual rental of more than $300,000.
  (b) In the event that the President or the Secretary proposes to the Congress the funding of any construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition to which subsection (a) of this section is applicable, the Secretary shall submit to each committee, on the same day, a prospectus of the proposed medical facility. Such prospectus shall include–
    (1) a detailed description of the medical facility to be constructed, altered, leased, or otherwise acquired under this subchapter, including a description of the location of such facility and, in the case of a prospectus proposing the construction of a new or replacement medical facility, a description of the consideration that was given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense under section 8111 of this title;
    (2) an estimate of the cost to the United States of the construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition of such facility (including site costs, if applicable); and
