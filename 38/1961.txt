   Notwithstanding section 1944(b) of this title, if the beneficiary of an insurance policy issued under the provisions of this subchapter receives the proceeds of such policy under a settlement option under which such proceeds are paid in equal monthly installments over a limited period of months, the interest that may be added to each such installment may be at a rate that is higher than the interest rate prescribed in such section. The Secretary may from time to time establish a higher interest rate under the preceding sentence only in accordance with a determination that such higher rate is administratively and actuarially sound. Any such higher interest rate shall be paid on the unpaid balance of such monthly installments.
