      (C) Whenever the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is required to submit a certification under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Comptroller General shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report stating the Comptroller General“s opinion as to whether the Director has complied with the requirements of that subparagraph. The Comptroller General shall submit the report not later than fifteen days after the end of the period specified in such subparagraph for the Director to submit the certification.
      (D) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ””funded personnel ceiling““ means, with respect to any fiscal year (or part of a fiscal year), the authorization by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to employ (under the appropriation accounts for medical care, medical and prosthetic research, and medical administration and miscellaneous operating expenses) not less than the number of employees for the employment of which appropriations have been made for such fiscal year (or part of a fiscal year).
    (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or of any other law, funds appropriated for the Department under the appropriation accounts for medical care, medical and prosthetic research, and medical administration and miscellaneous operating expenses may not be used for, and no employee compensated from such funds may carry out any activity in connection with, the conduct of any study comparing the cost of the provision by private contractors with the cost of the provision by the Department of commercial or industrial products and services for the Veterans Health Administration unless such funds have been specifically appropriated for that purpose.
    (6)      (A) Temporary research personnel of the Veterans Health Administration shall be excluded from any ceiling on full-time equivalent employees of the Department or any other personnel ceiling otherwise applicable to employees of the Department.

  (c)    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law but except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection–
      (A) a contract may not be entered into as a result of which an activity at a health-care facility over which the Secretary has direct jurisdiction (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a ””Department health-care facility““) would be converted from an activity performed by Federal employees to an activity performed by employees of a contractor of the Government unless the Under Secretary for Health has determined that such activity is not a direct patient care activity or an activity incident to direct patient care; and
      (B) in the case of an activity determined by the Under Secretary for Health under clause (A) of this paragraph to be neither such activity, the Secretary, after considering the advice of the Under Secretary for Health and the results of a study described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, may, in the exercise of the Secretary“s sole discretion but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, enter into a contract as a result of which the activity would be converted from an activity performed by Federal employees to an activity performed by employees of a contractor of the Government.

      (B) that the quantity and quality of health-care services provided to eligible veterans by the Department at the facility at which the activity is carried out would be maintained or enhanced as a result of such a contract.
