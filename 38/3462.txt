   Delimiting Period for Completion
  (a)    (1) Subject to paragraph (4) of this subsection, no educational assistance shall be afforded an eligible veteran under this chapter beyond the date 10 years after the veteran“s last discharge or release from active duty after January 31, 1955; except that, in the case of any eligible veteran who was prevented from initiating or completing such veteran“s chosen program of education within such time period because of a physical or mental disability which was not the result of such veteran“s own willful misconduct, such veteran shall, upon application made within one year after (A) the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable under this section, (B) the termination of the period of such mental or physical disability, or (C) October 1, 1980, whichever is the latest, be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period for such length of time as the Secretary determines, from the evidence, that such veteran was so prevented from initiating or completing such program of education. When an extension of the applicable delimiting period is granted a veteran under the preceding sentence, the delimiting period with respect to such veteran will again begin running on the first day following such veteran“s recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for such veteran to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.
    (2)      (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, any veteran shall be permitted to use any of such veteran“s unused entitlement under section 3461 of this title for the purposes of eligibility for an education loan, pursuant to the provisions of subchapter III of chapter 36 of this title, after the delimiting date otherwise applicable to such veteran under such paragraph (1), if such veteran was pursuing an approved program of education on a full-time basis at the time of the expiration of such veteran“s eligibility.
      (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, any veteran whose delimiting period is extended under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may continue to use any unused loan entitlement under this paragraph as long as the veteran continues to be enrolled on a full-time basis in pursuit of the approved program of education in which such veteran was enrolled at the time of expiration of such veteran“s eligibility (i) until such entitlement is exhausted, (ii) until the expiration of two years after November 23, 1977, or the date of the expiration of the delimiting date otherwise applicable to such veteran under paragraph (1) of this subsection, whichever is later, or (iii) until such veteran has completed the approved program of education in which such veteran was enrolled at the end of the delimiting period referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, whichever occurs first.
    (3)      (A) Subject to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, an eligible veteran who served on active duty during the Vietnam era shall be permitted to use any of such veteran“s unused entitlement under section 3461 of this title for the purpose of pursuing–
        (i) a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training;
        (ii) a course with an approved vocational objective; or
        (iii) a program of secondary education, if the veteran does not have a secondary school diploma (or an equivalency certificate).
      (B) Upon completion of a program or course pursued by virtue of eligibility provided by this paragraph, the Secretary shall provide the veteran with such employment counseling as may be necessary to assist the veteran in obtaining employment consistent with the veteran“s abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
      (C)        (i) Educational assistance shall be provided a veteran for pursuit of a program or course described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph using eligibility provided by this paragraph unless the Secretary determines, based on an examination of the veteran“s employment and training history, that the veteran is not in need of such a program or course in order to obtain a reasonably stable employment situation consistent with the veteran“s abilities and aptitudes. Any such determination shall be made in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe.
        (ii) Educational assistance provided a veteran for pursuit of a program described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph using eligibility provided by this paragraph shall be provided at the rate determined under section 3491(b)(2) of this title.
      (D) Educational assistance may not be provided by virtue of this paragraph after December 31, 1984.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a veteran“s last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from a period of active duty of less than 90 days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force as described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title.
       Correction of Discharge
  (b) In the case of any eligible veteran who has been prevented, as determined by the Secretary, from completing a program of education under this chapter within the period prescribed by subsection (a), because the veteran had not met the nature of discharge requirements of this chapter before a change, correction, or modification of a discharge or dismissal made pursuant to section 1553 of title 10, the correction of the military records of the proper service department under section 1552 of title 10, or other corrective action by competent authority, then the 10-year delimiting period shall run from the date the veteran“s discharge or dismissal was changed, corrected, or modified.
     Savings Clause
  (c) In the case of any eligible veteran who was discharged or released from active duty before June 1, 1966, the 10-year delimiting period shall run from such date, if it is later than the date which otherwise would be applicable. In the case of any eligible veteran who was discharged or released from active duty before August 31, 1967, and who pursues a course of farm cooperative training, apprenticeship or other training on the job, the 10-year delimiting period shall run from August 31, 1967, if it is later than the date which would otherwise be applicable.
  (d) In the case of any veteran (1) who served on or after January 31, 1955, (2) who became eligible for educational assistance under the provisions of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, and (3) who, subsequent to the veteran“s last discharge or release from active duty, was captured and held as a prisoner of war by a foreign government or power, there shall be excluded, in computing the veteran“s 10-year period of eligibility for educational assistance, any period during which the veteran was so detained and any period immediately following the veteran“s release from such detention during which the veteran was hospitalized at a military, civilian, or Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility.
  (e) No educational assistance shall be afforded any eligible veteran under this chapter or chapter 36 of this title after December 31, 1989.
