  (a) In this section, the term–
    (1) ””conviction notice date““ means the date on which an agency that employs a law enforcement officer has notice that the officer has been convicted of a felony that is entered by a Federal or State court, regardless of whether that conviction is appealed or is subject to appeal; and
    (2) ””law enforcement officer““ has the meaning given that term under section 8331(20) or 8401(17).
  (b) Any law enforcement officer who is convicted of a felony shall be removed from employment as a law enforcement officer on the last day of the first applicable pay period following the conviction notice date.
  (c)    (1) This section does not prohibit the removal of an individual from employment as a law enforcement officer before a conviction notice date if the removal is properly effected other than under this section.
    (2) This section does not prohibit the employment of any individual in any position other than that of a law enforcement officer.
