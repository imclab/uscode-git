  (a) The President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for–
    (1) open, competitive examinations for testing applicants for appointment in the competitive service which are practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought; and
    (2) noncompetitive examinations when competent applicants do not compete after notice has been given of the existence of the vacancy.
  (b) An individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title. This subsection does not take from the President any authority conferred by section 3301 of this title that is consistent with the provisions of this title governing the competitive service.
  (c)    (1) For the purpose of this subsection, the term ””technician““ has the meaning given such term by section 8337(h)(1) of this title.
    (2) Notwithstanding a contrary provision of this title or of the rules and regulations prescribed under this title for the administration of the competitive service, an individual who served for at least 3 years as a technician acquires a competitive status for transfer to the competitive service if such individual–
      (A) is involuntarily separated from service as a technician other than by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency;
      (B) passes a suitable noncompetitive examination; and
      (C) transfers to the competitive service within 1 year after separating from service as a technician.
  (d) The Office of Personnel Management shall promulgate regulations on the manner and extent that experience of an individual in a position other than the competitive service, such as the excepted service (as defined under section 2103) in the legislative or judicial branch, or in any private or nonprofit enterprise, may be considered in making appointments to a position in the competitive service (as defined under section 2102). In promulgating such regulations OPM shall not grant any preference based on the fact of service in the legislative or judicial branch. The regulations shall be consistent with the principles of equitable competition and merit based appointments.
  (e) Employees at any place outside the District of Columbia where the President or the Office of Personnel Management directs that examinations be held shall allow the reasonable use of public buildings for, and in all proper ways facilitate, holding the examinations.
