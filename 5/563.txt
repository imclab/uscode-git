      (A) can adequately represent the interests identified under paragraph (2); and

    (4) there is a reasonable likelihood that a committee will reach a consensus on the proposed rule within a fixed period of time;
    (5) the negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking and the issuance of the final rule;
    (6) the agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources, including technical assistance, to the committee; and
    (7) the agency, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the legal obligations of the agency, will use the consensus of the committee with respect to the proposed rule as the basis for the rule proposed by the agency for notice and comment.
