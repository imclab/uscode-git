  (b) The Office of Personnel Management may authorize the head of an agency to pay a bonus under this section to an individual only if–
    (1) the position to which such individual is appointed (as described in paragraph (2)(A)) or to which such individual moves or must relocate (as described in paragraph (2)(B)) is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of such a bonus; and
    (2) the individual–

  (d)    (1) Except as provided in subsection (e), a bonus under this section shall not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including a fractional part of a year, as determined under regulations of the Office) in the required service period of the employee involved.

    (2) in no event exceed 100 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period.
       Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to permit the waiver of any requirement under subsection (c).

  (g) The Office may prescribe regulations to carry out this section, including regulations relating to the repayment of a bonus under this section in appropriate circumstances when the agreed-upon service period has not been completed.
