Any such allotment shall be made at no cost to the exclusive representative or the employee. Except as provided under subsection (b) of this section, any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of 1 year.
  (b) An allotment under subsection (a) of this section for the deduction of dues with respect to any employee shall terminate whenâ€“
    (1) the agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative involved ceases to be applicable to the employee; or
    (2) the employee is suspended or expelled from membership in the exclusive representative.
