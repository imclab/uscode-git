  (a) For the purpose of this section, ””period for which he receives pay““ means the full calendar period for which a retired officer of a regular component of a uniformed service receives the pay of a position when employed on a full-time basis, but only the days for which he actually receives that pay when employed on a part-time or intermittent basis.
  (b) A retired officer of a regular component of a uniformed service who holds a position is entitled to receive the full pay of the position, but during the period for which he receives pay, his retired or retainer pay shall be reduced to an annual rate equal to the first $2,000 of the retired or retainer pay plus one-half of the remainder, if any. In the operation of the formula for the reduction of retired or retainer pay under this subsection, the amount of $2,000 shall be increased, from time to time, by appropriate percentage, in direct proportion to each increase in retired or retainer pay under section 1401a(b) of title 10 to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.
  (c)    (1) If any member or former member of a uniformed service is receiving retired or retainer pay and is employed in a position the annual rate of basic pay for which, when combined with the member“s annual rate of retired or retainer pay (reduced as provided under subsection (b) of this section), exceeds the rate of basic pay then currently paid for level V of the Executive Schedule, such member“s retired or retainer pay shall be reduced by an amount computed under paragraph (2) of this subsection. The amounts of the reductions shall be deposited to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States.
    (2) The amount of each reduction under paragraph (1) of this subsection allocable for any pay period in connection with employment in a position shall be equal to the retired or retainer pay allocable to the pay period (reduced as provided under subsection (b) of this section), except that the amount of the reduction may not result in–
      (A) the amount of retired or retainer pay allocable to the pay period after being reduced, when combined with the basic pay for the employment during the pay period, being at a rate less than the rate of basic pay then currently paid for level V of the Executive Schedule; or
      (B) the amount of retired pay or retainer pay being reduced to an amount less than the amount deducted from the retired or retainer pay as a result of participation in any survivor“s benefits in connection with the retired or retainer pay or veterans insurance programs.
  (d) The reduction in retired or retainer pay required by this section does not apply to a member or former member of a uniformed service who is receiving retired or retainer pay–

      (B) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of duty during a period of war as defined by sections 101 and 1101 of title 38; or
    (2) employed on a temporary (full-time or part-time) basis, any other part-time basis, or an intermittent basis, for the first 30-day period for which he receives pay.
       The exemption from reduction in retired or retainer pay under paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply longer than–
      (i) the first 30-day period for which he receives pay under one appointment from the position in which he is employed, if he is serving under not more than one appointment; and
      (ii) the first period for which he receives pay under more than one appointment, in a fiscal year, which consists in the aggregate of 30 days, from all positions in which he is employed, if he is serving under more than one appointment in that fiscal year.
  (e) The Office of Personnel Management may, during the 5-year period after the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 authorize exceptions to the restrictions in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section only when necessary to meet special or emergency employment needs which result from a severe shortage of well qualified candidates in positions of medical officers which otherwise cannot be readily met. An exception granted by the Office with respect to any individual shall terminate upon a break in service of 3 days or more.
  (f)    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the retired or retainer pay of a former member of a uniformed service shall not be reduced while such former member is temporarily employed, during the period described in paragraph (2) or any portion thereof, under the administrative authority of the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, or of the Secretary of Defense to perform duties in the operation of the air traffic control system or to train others to perform such duties.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be in effect for any period ending not later than December 31, 1989, during which the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, or the Secretary of Defense determines that there is an unusual shortage of air traffic controllers performing duties under the administrative authority of such Administrator or such Secretary, respectively.
