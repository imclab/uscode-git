   It is the policy of Congress that Federal pay fixing for employees under the General Schedule be based on the principles thatâ€“
  (1) there be equal pay for substantially equal work within each local pay area;
  (2) within each local pay area, pay distinctions be maintained in keeping with work and performance distinctions;
  (3) Federal pay rates be comparable with non-Federal pay rates for the same levels of work within the same local pay area; and
  (4) any existing pay disparities between Federal and non-Federal employees should be completely eliminated.
