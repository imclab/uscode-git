  (a) Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or any other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United States, the agency shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Such analysis shall describe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis or a summary shall be published in the Federal Register at the time of the publication of general notice of proposed rulemaking for the rule. The agency shall transmit a copy of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. In the case of an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United States, this chapter applies to interpretative rules published in the Federal Register for codification in the Code of Federal Regulations, but only to the extent that such interpretative rules impose on small entities a collection of information requirement.
  (b) Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis required under this section shall contain–
    (1) a description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered;
    (2) a succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule;
    (3) a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which the proposed rule will apply;
    (4) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record;
    (5) an identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, overlap or conflict with the proposed rule.
  (c) Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis shall also contain a description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities. Consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, the analysis shall discuss significant alternatives such as–
    (1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities;
    (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities;
    (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and
    (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.
  (d)    (1) For a covered agency, as defined in section 609(d)(2), each initial regulatory flexibility analysis shall include a description of–
      (A) any projected increase in the cost of credit for small entities;
      (B) any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any increase in the cost of credit for small entities; and
      (C) advice and recommendations of representatives of small entities relating to issues described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) and subsection (b).
    (2) A covered agency, as defined in section 609(d)(2), shall, for purposes of complying with paragraph (1)(C)–
      (A) identify representatives of small entities in consultation with the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration; and
      (B) collect advice and recommendations from the representatives identified under subparagraph (A) relating to issues described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) and subsection (b).
