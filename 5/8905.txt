      (B) a newly approved health benefits plan is offered, or

         provide a period of not less than 3 weeks during which any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan described by such section shall be permitted to transfer that individual“s enrollment to another such plan or to cancel such enrollment.

If such employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall change the enrollment of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the plan in which the employee is enrolled if that plan provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides. If the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not provide full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides, or, if the employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides, the employing agency shall change the coverage of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefits Plan.
    (3) The employee may not discontinue the self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides for so long as the court or administrative order remains in effect and the child continues to meet the requirements of section 8901(5), unless the employee provides documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance.
