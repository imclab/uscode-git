          (II) the old-age insurance benefit which would be so payable, excluding all wages derived from Federal service of the individual, and assuming the individual were fully insured (as defined by section 214(a) of the Social Security Act).
        (ii) For purposes of this subsection, the amount of a benefit referred to in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) shall be determined without regard to subsections (b) through (T3lK) of section 203 of the Social Security Act, and without regard to the requirement that an application for such benefit be filed.

    (4) A reduction under this subsection applies with respect to the annuity otherwise payable to such individual under this subchapter (other than under section 8337) for the month involved–

      (A) a disability annuity to which an individual described in section 8402(b)(2) is entitled under this subchapter, and
      (B) a survivor annuity to which a person is entitled under this subchapter based on the service of an individual described in section 8402(b)(2),

    (2)      (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), reductions under this subsection shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner in which reductions under subsection (a) are computed and otherwise made.
      (B) Reductions under this subsection shall be discontinued if, or for so long as, entitlement to the similar benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (as referred to in paragraph (1)) is terminated (or, in the case of an individual who has not made proper application therefor, would be terminated).
    (3) For the purpose of applying section 224 of the Social Security Act to the disability insurance benefit used to compute the reduction under this subsection, the amount of the CSRS annuity considered shall be the amount of the CSRS annuity before application of this section.
    (4) The Office shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection.
  (c) For the purpose of this section, the term ””Federal service““ means service which is employment for the purposes of title II of the Social Security Act and chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by reason of the amendments made by section 101 of the Social Security Amendments of 1983.
