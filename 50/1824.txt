    (2) the application has been made by a Federal officer and approved by the Attorney General;
    (3) on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to believe that–
      (A) the target of the physical search is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, except that no United States person may be considered an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and
      (B) the premises or property to be searched is owned, used, possessed by, or is in transit to or from an agent of a foreign power or a foreign power;
    (4) the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization contained in this subchapter; and
    (5) the application which has been filed contains all statements and certifications required by section 1823 of this title, and, if the target is a United States person, the certification or certifications are not clearly erroneous on the basis of the statement made under section 1823(a)(7)(E) of this title and any other information furnished under section 1823(c) of this title.
  (b) Specifications and directions of orders
     An order approving a physical search under this section shall–

      (A) the identity, if known, or a description of the target of the physical search;
      (B) the nature and location of each of the premises or property to be searched;
      (C) the type of information, material, or property to be seized, altered, or reproduced;
      (D) a statement of the manner in which the physical search is to be conducted and, whenever more than one physical search is authorized under the order, the authorized scope of each search and what minimization procedures shall apply to the information acquired by each search; and
      (E) the period of time during which physical searches are approved; and
    (2) direct–
      (A) that the minimization procedures be followed;
      (B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified landlord, custodian, or other specified person furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the physical search in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such landlord, custodian, or other person is providing the target of the physical search;
      (C) that such landlord, custodian, or other person maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence any records concerning the search or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain;

      (E) that the Federal officer conducting the physical search promptly report to the court the circumstances and results of the physical search.

    (2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be granted on the same basis as the original order upon an application for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as required for the original order, except that an extension of an order under this chapter for a physical search targeted against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this title, or against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(4) of this title, that is not a United States person, may be for a period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable cause to believe that no property of any individual United States person will be acquired during the period.
    (3) At or before the end of the period of time for which a physical search is approved by an order or an extension, or at any time after a physical search is carried out, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.
  (d) Emergency orders
    (1)      (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, whenever the Attorney General reasonably makes the determination specified in subparagraph (B), the Attorney General may authorize the execution of an emergency physical search if–
        (i) a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title is informed by the Attorney General or the Attorney General“s designee at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to execute an emergency search, and
        (ii) an application in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as practicable but not more than 24 hours after the Attorney General authorizes such search.
      (B) The determination referred to in subparagraph (A) is a determination that–
        (i) an emergency situation exists with respect to the execution of a physical search to obtain foreign intelligence information before an order authorizing such search can with due diligence be obtained, and
        (ii) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such a search exists.
    (2) If the Attorney General authorizes an emergency search under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.
    (3) In the absence of a judicial order approving such a physical search, the search shall terminate the earlier of–
      (A) the date on which the information sought is obtained;
      (B) the date on which the application for the order is denied; or
      (C) the expiration of 24 hours from the time of authorization by the Attorney General.
    (4) In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the physical search is terminated and no order is issued approving the search, no information obtained or evidence derived from such search shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such search shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General, if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 1822 of this title.
  (e) Retention of applications and orders
     Applications made and orders granted under this subchapter shall be retained for a period of at least 10 years from the date of the application.
