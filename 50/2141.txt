    (1) Conformity to CSRS by Executive order
       Whenever the President determines that it would be appropriate for the purpose of maintaining existing conformity between the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System with respect to substantially identical provisions, the President may, by Executive order, extend to current or former participants in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, or to their survivors, a provision of law enacted after January 1, 1975, which–
      (A) amends subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 and is applicable to civil service employees generally; or
      (B) otherwise affects current or former participants in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System, or their survivors.
    (2) Extension to CIARDS
       Any such order shall extend such provision of law so that it applies in like manner with respect to such Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System participants, former participants, or survivors.
    (3) Legal status
       Any such order shall have the force and effect of law.
    (4) Effective date
       Any such order may be given retroactive effect to a date not earlier than the effective date of the corresponding provision of law applicable to employees under the Civil Service Retirement System.
  (b) Effect of Executive order
     Provisions of an Executive order issued pursuant to this section shall modify, supersede, or render inapplicable, as the case may be, to the extent inconsistent therewith–
    (1) provisions of law enacted before the effective date of the Executive order; and
    (2) any prior provision of an Executive order issued under this section.
