   The 9/11 Commission has made the following recommendations:
  (1) Strengthen ””counter-proliferation““ efforts
     The United States should work with the international community to develop laws and an international legal regime with universal jurisdiction to enable any state in the world to capture, interdict, and prosecute smugglers of nuclear material.
  (2) Expand the Proliferation Security Initiative
     In carrying out the Proliferation Security Initiative, the United States should–
    (A) use intelligence and planning resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance;
    (B) make participation open to non-NATO countries; and
    (C) encourage Russia and the People“s Republic of China to participate.
  (3) Support the Cooperative Threat Reduction program
     The United States should expand, improve, increase resources for, and otherwise fully support the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
