It shall include–
    (1) the identity of the Federal officer making the application;
    (2) the authority conferred on the Attorney General by the President of the United States and the approval of the Attorney General to make the application;
    (3) the identity, if known, or a description of the target of the electronic surveillance;
    (4) a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify his belief that–
      (A) the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; and
      (B) each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
    (5) a statement of the proposed minimization procedures;
    (6) a detailed description of the nature of the information sought and the type of communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance;

      (A) that the certifying official deems the information sought to be foreign intelligence information;
      (B) that a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information;
      (C) that such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques;
      (D) that designates the type of foreign intelligence information being sought according to the categories described in section 1801(e) of this title; and

    (10) a statement of the period of time for which the electronic surveillance is required to be maintained, and if the nature of the intelligence gathering is such that the approval of the use of electronic surveillance under this subchapter should not automatically terminate when the described type of information has first been obtained, a description of facts supporting the belief that additional information of the same type will be obtained thereafter; and
    (11) whenever more than one electronic, mechanical or other surveillance device is to be used with respect to a particular proposed electronic surveillance, the coverage of the devices involved and what minimization procedures apply to information acquired by each device.
  (b) Exclusion of certain information respecting foreign power targets
     Whenever the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title, and each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is owned, leased, or exclusively used by that foreign power, the application need not contain the information required by paragraphs (6), (7)(E), (8), and (11) of subsection (a) of this section, but shall state whether physical entry is required to effect the surveillance and shall contain such information about the surveillance techniques and communications or other information concerning United States persons likely to be obtained as may be necessary to assess the proposed minimization procedures.
  (c) Additional affidavits or certifications
     The Attorney General may require any other affidavit or certification from any other officer in connection with the application.
