    (2) an assessment by the Administrator of whether both the budget for such fiscal year and the future-years nuclear security program submitted to Congress in relation to such budget under section 2453 of this title provide for funding of the nuclear security complex at a level that is sufficient for the modernization and refurbishment of the nuclear security complex in accordance with the plan described under subsection (b).

      (B) the nuclear posture of the United States as set forth in the most recent Nuclear Posture Review.
    (2) The plan required under subsection (a)(1) shall include the following:
      (A) A description of the modernization and refurbishment measures the Administrator determines necessary to meet the requirements of the national security strategy of the United States or the most recent Quadrennial Defense Review, whichever is applicable under paragraph (1)(A), and the Nuclear Posture Review.
      (B) A schedule for implementing those measures determined necessary under subparagraph (A) during the 10 years following the date of the plan.

  (c) Budget assessment
     If the Administrator determines a budget request is insufficient for the modernization and refurbishment of the nuclear security complex provided for in the plan required under subsection (a)(1), the Administrator shall include with the nuclear security budget materials for such fiscal year a further assessment that describes and discusses the risks and implications associated with the ability of the nuclear security complex to support the annual certification of the nuclear stockpile of the United States and maintain its long-term safety, security, and reliability.
