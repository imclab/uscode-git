   It is the sense of Congress thatâ€“
  (1) the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs and other United States programs authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994 should be expanded by offering assistance under those programs to other independent states of the former Soviet Union in addition to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus; and
  (2) the President should offer assistance to additional independent states of the former Soviet Union in each case in which the participation of such states would benefit national security interests of the United States by improving border controls and safeguards over materials and technology associated with weapons of mass destruction.
