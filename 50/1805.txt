  (a) Necessary findings
     Upon an application made pursuant to section 1804 of this title, the judge shall enter an ex parte order as requested or as modified approving the electronic surveillance if he finds that–
    (1) the President has authorized the Attorney General to approve applications for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information;
    (2) the application has been made by a Federal officer and approved by the Attorney General;
    (3) on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to believe that–
      (A) the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power: T3ProvidedK, That no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and
      (B) each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
    (4) the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 1804(h) of this title; and
    (5) the application which has been filed contains all statements and certifications required by section 1804 of this title and, if the target is a United States person, the certification or certifications are not clearly erroneous on the basis of the statement made under section 1804(a)(7)(E) of this title and any other information furnished under section 1804(d) of this title.
  (b) Determination of probable cause
     In determining whether or not probable cause exists for purposes of an order under subsection (a)(3) of this section, a judge may consider past activities of the target, as well as facts and circumstances relating to current or future activities of the target.
  (c) Specifications and directions of orders
     An order approving an electronic surveillance under this section shall–
    (1) specify–
      (A) the identity, if known, or a description of the target of the electronic surveillance;
      (B) the nature and location of each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance will be directed;
      (C) the type of information sought to be acquired and the type of communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance;
      (D) the means by which the electronic surveillance will be effected and whether physical entry will be used to effect the surveillance;
      (E) the period of time during which the electronic surveillance is approved; and
      (F) whenever more than one electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device is to be used under the order, the authorized coverage of the devices involved and what minimization procedures shall apply to information subject to acquisition by each device; and
    (2) direct–
      (A) that the minimization procedures be followed;
      (B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified communication or other common carrier, landlord, custodian, or other specified person furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish the electronic surveillance in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person is providing that target of electronic surveillance;
      (C) that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence any records concerning the surveillance or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain; and
      (D) that the applicant compensate, at the prevailing rate, such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person for furnishing such aid.
  (d) Exclusion of certain information respecting foreign power targets
     Whenever the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title, and each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is owned, leased, or exclusively used by that foreign power, the order need not contain the information required by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (F) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, but shall generally describe the information sought, the communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance, and the type of electronic surveillance involved, including whether physical entry is required.
  (e) Duration of order; extensions; review of circumstances under which information was acquired, retained or disseminated
    (1) An order issued under this section may approve an electronic surveillance for the period necessary to achieve its purpose, or for ninety days, whichever is less, except that an order under this section shall approve an electronic surveillance targeted against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title, for the period specified in the application or for one year, whichever is less.
    (2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be granted on the same basis as an original order upon an application for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as required for an original order, except that an extension of an order under this chapter for a surveillance targeted against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this title, or against a foreign power as defined in section 1801(a)(4) of this title that is not a United States person, may be for a period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable cause to believe that no communication of any individual United States person will be acquired during the period.
    (3) At or before the end of the period of time for which electronic surveillance is approved by an order or an extension, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.
  (f) Emergency orders
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, when the Attorney General reasonably determines that–
    (1) an emergency situation exists with respect to the employment of electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information before an order authorizing such surveillance can with due diligence be obtained; and
    (2) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such surveillance exists;
       he may authorize the emergency employment of electronic surveillance if a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title is informed by the Attorney General or his designee at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance and if an application in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as practicable, but not more than twenty-four hours after the Attorney General authorizes such surveillance. If the Attorney General authorizes such emergency employment of electronic surveillance, he shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed. In the absence of a judicial order approving such electronic surveillance, the surveillance shall terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the application for the order is denied, or after the expiration of twenty-four hours from the time of authorization by the Attorney General, whichever is earliest. In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the electronic surveillance is terminated and no order is issued approving the surveillance, no information obtained or evidence derived from such surveillance shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such surveillance shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 1803 of this title.
  (g) Testing of electronic equipment; discovering unauthorized electronic surveillance; training of intelligence personnel
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, officers, employees, or agents of the United States are authorized in the normal course of their official duties to conduct electronic surveillance not targeted against the communications of any particular person or persons, under procedures approved by the Attorney General, solely to–
    (1) test the capability of electronic equipment, if–
      (A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of the persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;
      (B) the test is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to determine the capability of the equipment;
      (C) the contents of any communication acquired are retained and used only for the purpose of determining the capability of the equipment, are disclosed only to test personnel, and are destroyed before or immediately upon completion of the test; and:
      (D) T3ProvidedK, That the test may exceed ninety days only with the prior approval of the Attorney General;
    (2) determine the existence and capability of electronic surveillance equipment being used by persons not authorized to conduct electronic surveillance, if–
      (A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;
      (B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to determine the existence and capability of such equipment; and
      (C) any information acquired by such surveillance is used only to enforce chapter 119 of title 18, or section 605 of title 47, or to protect information from unauthorized surveillance; or
    (3) train intelligence personnel in the use of electronic surveillance equipment, if–
      (A) it is not reasonable to–
        (i) obtain the consent of the persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;
        (ii) train persons in the course of surveillances otherwise authorized by this subchapter; or
        (iii) train persons in the use of such equipment without engaging in electronic surveillance;
      (B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to train the personnel in the use of the equipment; and
      (C) no contents of any communication acquired are retained or disseminated for any purpose, but are destroyed as soon as reasonably possible.
  (h) Retention of certifications, applications and orders
     Certifications made by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1802(a) of this title and applications made and orders granted under this subchapter shall be retained for a period of at least ten years from the date of the certification or application.
