      (B) the United States should undertake and support an enduring stockpile stewardship program and maintain and modernize nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the United States nuclear deterrent and to meet requirements for hedging against possible international developments or technical problems;
      (C) the United States should maintain nuclear weapons laboratories and plants and preserve the intellectual infrastructure, including competencies and skill sets; and
      (D) the United States should provide the necessary resources to achieve these goals, using as a starting point the levels set forth in the President“s 10-year plan provided to Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2549).
    (2) Report
       If the President determines that an appropriations Act is enacted that fails to meet the resource requirements set forth in the plan referred to in section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2549), or, if at any time, determines that more resources are required to carry out such plan than were estimated, the President shall submit to Congress, within 60 days of making such a determination, a report detailing–
      (A) a plan to address the resource shortfall;
      (B) if more resources are required to carry out the plan than were estimated, the level of funding needed, and a detailed explanation of the purpose or purposes for which the additional resources will be used;
      (C) any effects on the safety, security, reliability, or credibility of United States nuclear forces due to the shortfall or the identified additional resources required; and
      (D) an explanation of whether any planned reductions in United States nuclear forces are still in the national interest of the United States in view of the resource shortfall or the identification of additional required resources.

      (B) such investments could enable additional future reductions in the hedge stockpile.
