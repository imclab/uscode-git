    (1) In general
       Under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director, a participant may voluntarily contribute additional sums in multiples of one percent of the participant“s basic pay, but not in excess of 10 percent of such basic pay.
    (2) Interest
       The voluntary contribution account in each case is the sum of unrefunded contributions, plus interest–
      (A) for periods before January 1, 1985, at 3 percent a year; and
      (B) for periods on or after January 1, 1985, at the rate computed under section 8334(e) of title 5,
       compounded annually to the date of election under subsection (b) of this section or the date of payment under subsection (d) of this section.
  (b) Treatment of voluntary contributions
     Effective on the date of retirement and at the election of the participant, the participant“s account shall be–
    (1) returned in a lump sum;
    (2) used to purchase an additional life annuity;
    (3) used to purchase an additional life annuity for the participant and to provide for a cash payment on the participant“s death to a beneficiary; or
    (4) used to purchase an additional life annuity for the participant and a life annuity commencing on the participant“s death payable to a beneficiary, with a guaranteed return to the beneficiary or the beneficiary“s legal representative of an amount equal to the cash payment referred to in paragraph (3).
       In the case of a benefit provided under paragraph (3) or (4), the participant shall notify the Director in writing of the name of the beneficiary of the cash payment or life annuity to be paid upon the participant“s death.
  (c) Value of benefits
     The benefits provided by subsection (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section shall be actuarially equivalent in value to the payment provided for in subsection (b)(1) of this section and shall be calculated upon such tables of mortality as may be from time to time prescribed for this purpose by the Director.
  (d) Lump-sum payment
     A voluntary contribution account shall be paid in a lump sum at such time as the participant dies or separates from the Agency without entitlement to an annuity. In the case of death, the account shall be paid in the order of precedence specified in section 2071(c) of this title.
