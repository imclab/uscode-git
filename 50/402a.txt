     There is established within the executive branch of Government a National Counterintelligence Policy Board (in this section referred to as the ””Board““). The Board shall report to the President through the National Security Council.
  (b) Function of Board
     The Board shall serve as the principal mechanism for–
    (1) developing policies and procedures for the approval of the President to govern the conduct of counterintelligence activities; and
    (2) resolving conflicts, as directed by the President, which may arise between elements of the Government which carry out such activities.
  (c) Coordination of counterintelligence matters with Federal Bureau of Investigation
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the head of each department or agency within the executive branch shall ensure that–
      (A) the Federal Bureau of Investigation is advised immediately of any information, regardless of its origin, which indicates that classified information is being, or may have been, disclosed in an unauthorized manner to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
      (B) following a report made pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Federal Bureau of Investigation is consulted with respect to all subsequent actions which may be undertaken by the department or agency concerned to determine the source of such loss or compromise; and
      (C) where, after appropriate consultation with the department or agency concerned, the Federal Bureau of Investigation undertakes investigative activities to determine the source of the loss or compromise, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is given complete and timely access to the employees and records of the department or agency concerned for purposes of such investigative activities.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall ensure that espionage information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to the personnel, operations, or information of departments or agencies of the executive branch, is provided through appropriate channels to the department or agency concerned, and that such departments or agencies are consulted with respect to espionage investigations undertaken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation which involve the personnel, operations, or information of such department or agency after a report has been provided pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).
    (3) Where essential to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital national security interests of the United States, the President may on a case-by-case basis waive the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2), as they apply to the head of a particular department or agency, or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such waiver shall be in writing and shall fully state the justification for such waiver. Within thirty days, the President shall notify the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives that such waiver has been issued, and at that time or as soon as national security considerations permit, provide these committees with a complete explanation of the circumstances which necessitated such waiver.
    (4) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense, report annually, beginning on February 1, 1995, and continuing each year thereafter, to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and, in accordance with applicable security procedures, the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate with respect to compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) during the previous calendar year.
    (5) Nothing in this section may be construed to alter the existing jurisdictional arrangements between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Defense with respect to investigations of persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, nor to impose additional reporting requirements upon the Department of Defense with respect to such investigations beyond those required by existing law and executive branch policy.
    (6) As used in this section, the terms ””foreign power““ and ””agent of a foreign power““ have the same meanings as set forth in sections \1\N 1801(a) and (b), respectively, of this title.
