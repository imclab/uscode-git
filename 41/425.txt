   The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall promulgate regulations to discourage the use of a nonstandard contract clause on a repetitive basis. The regulations shall include provisions thatâ€“
  (1) clearly define what types of contract clauses are to be treated as nonstandard clauses; and
  (2) require prior approval for the use of a nonstandard clause on a repetitive basis by an official at a level of responsibility above the contracting officer.
