    (10) provide for the payment of interest accruing after the date of the filing of the petition on unsecured claims that are nondischargeable under section 1328(a), except that such interest may be paid only to the extent that the debtor has disposable income available to pay such interest after making provision for full payment of all allowed claims; and
    (11) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.
  (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) and applicable nonbankruptcy law–
    (1) a default with respect to, or that gave rise to, a lien on the debtor“s principal residence may be cured under paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (b) until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law; and
    (2) in a case in which the last payment on the original payment schedule for a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor“s principal residence is due before the date on which the final payment under the plan is due, the plan may provide for the payment of the claim as modified pursuant to section 1325(a)(5) of this title.

         the plan may not provide for payments over a period that is longer than 5 years.
    (2) If the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor“s spouse combined, when multiplied by 12, is less than–
      (A) in the case of a debtor in a household of 1 person, the median family income of the applicable State for 1 earner;
      (B) in the case of a debtor in a household of 2, 3, or 4 individuals, the highest median family income of the applicable State for a family of the same number or fewer individuals; or
