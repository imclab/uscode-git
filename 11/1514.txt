  (c) When a notification of commencement of a case is to be given to foreign creditors, such notification shallâ€“
    (1) indicate the time period for filing proofs of claim and specify the place for filing such proofs of claim;
    (2) indicate whether secured creditors need to file proofs of claim; and
    (3) contain any other information required to be included in such notification to creditors under this title and the orders of the court.
  (d) Any rule of procedure or order of the court as to notice or the filing of a proof of claim shall provide such additional time to creditors with foreign addresses as is reasonable under the circumstances.
