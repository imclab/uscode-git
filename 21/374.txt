     Whenever in the course of any such inspection of a factory or other establishment where food is manufactured, processed, or packed, the officer or employee making the inspection obtains a sample of any such food, and an analysis is made of such sample for the purpose of ascertaining whether such food consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food, a copy of the results of such analysis shall be furnished promptly to the owner, operator, or agent in charge.
  (e) Accessibility of records
     Every person required under section 360i or 360j(g) of this title to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of such records shall, upon request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have access to, and to copy and verify, such records.

The owner or operator of such an establishment that is eligible under paragraph (6) may, from the list published under paragraph (4), select an accredited person to conduct such inspections.
    (2) Not later than 180 days after October 26, 2002, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register criteria to accredit or deny accreditation to persons who request to perform the duties specified in paragraph (1). Thereafter, the Secretary shall inform those requesting accreditation, within 60 days after the receipt of such request, whether the request for accreditation is adequate for review, and the Secretary shall promptly act on the request for accreditation. Any resulting accreditation shall state that such person is accredited to conduct inspections at device establishments identified in paragraph (1). The accreditation of such person shall specify the particular activities under this subsection for which such person is accredited. In the first year following the publication in the Federal Register of criteria to accredit or deny accreditation to persons who request to perform the duties specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall accredit no more than 15 persons who request to perform duties specified in paragraph (1).

        (ii) limit work to that for which competence and capacity are available;
        (iii) treat information received, records, reports, and recommendations as confidential commercial or financial information or trade secret information, except such information may be made available to the Secretary;
        (iv) promptly respond and attempt to resolve complaints regarding its activities for which it is accredited; and
        (v) protect against the use, in carrying out paragraph (1), of any officer or employee of the accredited person who has a financial conflict of interest regarding any product regulated under this chapter, and annually make available to the public disclosures of the extent to which the accredited person, and the officers and employees of the person, have maintained compliance with requirements under this clause relating to financial conflicts of interest.
    (4) The Secretary shall publish on the Internet site of the Food and Drug Administration a list of persons who are accredited under paragraph (2). Such list shall be updated to ensure that the identity of each accredited person, and the particular activities for which the person is accredited, is known to the public. The updating of such list shall be no later than one month after the accreditation of a person under this subsection or the suspension or withdrawal of accreditation, or the modification of the particular activities for which the person is accredited.
    (5)      (A) To ensure that persons accredited under this subsection continue to meet the standards of accreditation, the Secretary shall (i) audit the performance of such persons on a periodic basis through the review of inspection reports and inspections by persons designated by the Secretary to evaluate the compliance status of a device establishment and the performance of accredited persons, and (ii) take such additional measures as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
      (B) The Secretary may withdraw accreditation of any person accredited under paragraph (2), after providing notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing, when such person is substantially not in compliance with the standards of accreditation, or poses a threat to public health or fails to act in a manner that is consistent with the purposes of this subsection. The Secretary may suspend the accreditation of such person during the pendency of the process under the preceding sentence.
    (6)      (A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), a device establishment is eligible for inspections by persons accredited under paragraph (2) if the following conditions are met:
        (i) The Secretary classified the results of the most recent inspection of the establishment pursuant to subsection (h) or (i) of section 360 of this title as ””no action indicated““ or ””voluntary action indicated““.
        (ii) With respect to each inspection to be conducted by an accredited person–
          (I) the owner or operator of the establishment submits to the Secretary a notice requesting clearance to use such a person to conduct the inspection, and the Secretary provides such clearance; and
          (II) such notice identifies the accredited person whom the establishment has selected to conduct the inspection, and the Secretary agrees to the selected accredited person.
        (iii) With respect to the devices that are manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by the establishment, at least one of such devices is marketed in the United States, and the following additional conditions are met:
          (I) At least one of such devices is marketed, or is intended to be marketed, in one or more foreign countries, one of which countries certifies, accredits, or otherwise recognizes the person accredited under paragraph (2) and identified under subclause (II) of this clause.
          (II) The owner or operator of the establishment submits to the Secretary a statement that the law of a country in which such a device is marketed, or is intended to be marketed, recognizes an inspection of the establishment by the Secretary, and not later than 30 days after receiving such statement, the Secretary informs the owner or operator of the establishment that the owner or operator may submit a notice requesting clearance under clause (ii).
        (iv)          (I) In the case of an inspection to be conducted pursuant to 360(h) of this title, persons accredited under paragraph (2) did not conduct the two immediately preceding inspections of the establishment, except that the establishment may petition the Secretary for a waiver of such condition. Such a waiver may be granted only if the petition states a commercial reason for the waiver; the Secretary determines that the public health would be served by granting the waiver; and the Secretary has conducted an inspection of the establishment during the four-year period preceding the date on which the notice under clause (ii) is submitted to the Secretary. Such a waiver is deemed to be granted only if the petition states a commercial reason for the waiver; the Secretary has not determined that the public health would be served by granting the waiver; and the owner or operator of the device establishment has requested in writing, not later than 18 months following the most recent inspection of such establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2), that the Secretary inspect the establishment and the Secretary has not conducted an inspection within 30 months after the most recent inspection. With respect to such a waiver that is granted or deemed to be granted, no additional such waiver may be granted until after the Secretary has conducted an inspection of the establishment.
          (II) In the case of an inspection to be conducted pursuant to 360(i) of this title, the Secretary periodically conducts inspections of the establishment.
      (B)        (i) The Secretary shall respond to a notice under subparagraph (A) from a device establishment not later than 30 days after the Secretary receives the notice. Through such response, the Secretary shall (I) provide clearance under such subparagraph, and agree to the selection of an accredited person, or (II) make a request under clause (ii). If the Secretary fails to respond to the notice within such 30-day period, the establishment is deemed to have such clearance, and to have the agreement of the Secretary for such selection.
        (ii) The request referred to in clause (i)(II) is–
          (I) a request to the device establishment involved to submit to the Secretary compliance data in accordance with clause (iii); or
          (II) a request to the establishment, or to the accredited person identified in the notice under subparagraph (A), for information concerning the relationship between the establishment and such accredited person, including information about the number of inspections of the establishment, or other establishments owned or operated by the owner or operator of the establishment, that have been conducted by the accredited person.
             The Secretary may make both such requests.
        (iii) The compliance data to be submitted by a device establishment under clause (ii) are data describing whether the quality controls of the establishment have been sufficient for ensuring consistent compliance with current good manufacturing practice within the meaning of section 351(h) of this title, and data otherwise describing whether the establishment has consistently been in compliance with sections 351 and 352 of this title and other applicable provisions of this chapter. Such data shall include complete reports of inspections regarding good manufacturing practice or other quality control audits that, during the preceding two-year period, were conducted at the establishment by persons other than the owner or operator of the establishment, together with all other compliance data the Secretary deems necessary. Data under the preceding sentence shall demonstrate to the Secretary whether the establishment has facilitated consistent compliance by promptly correcting any compliance problems identified in such inspections.
        (iv) Not later than 60 days after receiving compliance data under clause (iii) from a device establishment, the Secretary shall provide or deny clearance under subparagraph (A). The Secretary may deny clearance if the Secretary determines that the establishment has failed to demonstrate consistent compliance for purposes of clause (iii). The Secretary shall provide to the establishment a statement of such reasons for such determination. If the Secretary fails to provide such statement to the establishment within such 60-day period, the establishment is deemed to have such clearance.
        (v)          (I) A request to an accredited person under clause (ii)(II) may not seek any information that is not required to be maintained by such person in records under subsection (f)(1) of this section. Not later than 60 days after receiving the information sought by the request, the Secretary shall agree to, or reject, the selection of such person by the device establishment involved. The Secretary may reject the selection if the Secretary provides to the establishment a statement of the reasons for such rejection. Reasons for the rejection may include that the establishment or the accredited person, as the case may be, has failed to fully respond to the request, or that the Secretary has concerns regarding the relationship between the establishment and such accredited person. If within such 60-day period the Secretary fails to agree to or reject the selection in accordance with this subclause, the Secretary is deemed to have agreed to the selection.
          (II) If the Secretary rejects the selection of an accredited person by a device establishment, the establishment may make an additional selection of an accredited person by submitting to the Secretary a notice that identifies the additional selection. Clauses (i) and (ii), and subclause (I) of this clause, apply to the selection of an accredited person through a notice under the preceding sentence in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions apply to a selection of an accredited person through a notice under subparagraph (A).
        (vi) In the case of a device establishment that under clause (iv) is denied clearance under subparagraph (A), or whose selection of an accredited person is rejected under clause (v), the Secretary shall designate a person to review the findings of the Secretary under such clause if, during the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the establishment receives the findings, the establishment requests the review. The review shall commence not later than 30 days after the establishment requests the review, unless the Secretary and the establishment otherwise agree.
      (C)        (i) In the case of a device establishment for which the Secretary classified the results of the most recent inspection of the establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2) as ””official action indicated““, the establishment, if otherwise eligible under subparagraph (A), is eligible for further inspections by persons accredited under such paragraph if (I) the Secretary issues a written statement to the owner or operator of the establishment that the violations leading to such classification have been resolved, and (II) the Secretary, either upon the Secretary“s own initiative or a petition of the owner or operator of the establishment, notifies the establishment that it has clearance to use an accredited person for the inspections. The Secretary shall respond to such petition within 30 days after the receipt of the petition.
        (ii) If the Secretary denies a petition under clause (i), the device establishment involved may, after the expiration of one year after such denial, again petition the Secretary for a determination of eligibility for inspection by persons accredited by the Secretary under paragraph (2). If the Secretary denies such petition, the Secretary shall provide the establishment with such reasons for such denial within 60 days after the denial. If, as of the expiration of 48 months after the receipt of the first petition, the establishment has not been inspected by the Secretary in accordance with section 360(h) of this title, or has not during such period been inspected pursuant to section 360(i) of this title, as applicable, the establishment is eligible for further inspections by accredited persons.
    (7)      (A) Persons accredited under paragraph (2) to conduct inspections shall record in writing their inspection observations and shall present the observations to the device establishment“s designated representative and describe each observation. Additionally, such accredited person shall prepare an inspection report (including for inspections classified as ””no action indicated““) in a form and manner consistent with such reports prepared by employees and officials designated by the Secretary to conduct inspections.
      (B) At a minimum, an inspection report under subparagraph (A) shall identify the persons responsible for good manufacturing practice compliance at the inspected device establishment, the dates of the inspection, the scope of the inspection, and shall describe in detail each observation identified by the accredited person, identify other matters that relate to or may influence compliance with this chapter, and describe any recommendations during the inspection or at the inspection“s closing meeting.
      (C) An inspection report under subparagraph (A) shall be sent to the Secretary and to the designated representative of the inspected device establishment at the same time, but under no circumstances later than three weeks after the last day of the inspection. The report to the Secretary shall be accompanied by all written inspection observations previously provided to the designated representative of the establishment.
      (D) Any statement or representation made by an employee or agent of a device establishment to a person accredited under paragraph (2) to conduct inspections shall be subject to section 1001 of title 18.
      (E) If at any time during an inspection by an accredited person the accredited person discovers a condition that could cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to the public health, the accredited person shall immediately notify the Secretary of the identification of the device establishment subject to inspection and such condition.
    (8) Compensation for an accredited person shall be determined by agreement between the accredited person and the person who engages the services of the accredited person, and shall be paid by the person who engages such services.
    (9) Nothing in this subsection affects the authority of the Secretary to inspect any device establishment pursuant to this chapter.
    (10)      (A) For fiscal year 2005 and each subsequent fiscal year, no device establishment may be inspected during the fiscal year involved by a person accredited under paragraph (2) if–
        (i) of the amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the preceding fiscal year (referred to in this subparagraph as the ””first prior fiscal year““), the amount obligated by the Secretary for inspections of device establishments by the Secretary was less than the adjusted base amount applicable to such first prior fiscal year; and
        (ii) of the amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year preceding the first prior fiscal year (referred to in this subparagraph as the ””second prior fiscal year““), the amount obligated by the Secretary for inspections of device establishments by the Secretary was less than the adjusted base amount applicable to such second prior fiscal year.
      (B)        (i) Subject to clause (ii), the Comptroller General of the United States shall determine the amount that was obligated by the Secretary for fiscal year 2002 for compliance activities of the Food and Drug Administration with respect to devices (referred to in this subparagraph as the ””compliance budget““), and of such amount, the amount that was obligated for inspections by the Secretary of device establishments (referred to in this subparagraph as the ””inspection budget““).
        (ii) For purposes of determinations under clause (i), the Comptroller General shall not include in the compliance budget or the inspection budget any amounts obligated for inspections of device establishments conducted as part of the process of reviewing applications under section 360e of this title.
        (iii) Not later than March 31, 2003, the Comptroller General shall complete the determinations required in this subparagraph and submit to the Secretary and the Congress a reporting describing the findings made through such determinations.
      (C) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) The term ””base amount““ means the inspection budget determined under subparagraph (B) for fiscal year 2002.
        (ii) The term ””adjusted base amount““, in the case of applicability to fiscal year 2003, means an amount equal to the base amount increased by 5 percent.
        (iii) The term ””adjusted base amount““, with respect to applicability to fiscal year 2004 or any subsequent fiscal year, means the adjusted based amount applicable to the preceding year increased by 5 percent.
    (11) The authority provided by this subsection terminates on October 1, 2012.
    (12) No later than four years after October 26, 2002, the Comptroller General shall report to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate–
      (A) the number of inspections pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of section 360 of this title conducted by accredited persons and the number of inspections pursuant to such subsections conducted by Federal employees;
      (B) the number of persons who sought accreditation under this subsection, as well as the number of persons who were accredited under this subsection;
      (C) the reasons why persons who sought accreditation, but were denied accreditation, were denied;
      (D) the number of audits conducted by the Secretary of accredited persons, the quality of inspections conducted by accredited persons, whether accredited persons are meeting their obligations under this chapter, and whether the number of audits conducted is sufficient to permit these assessments;
      (E) whether this subsection is achieving the goal of ensuring more information about device establishment compliance is being presented to the Secretary, and whether that information is of a quality consistent with information obtained by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (h) or (i) of section 360 of this title;
      (F) whether this subsection is advancing efforts to allow device establishments to rely upon third-party inspections for purposes of compliance with the laws of foreign governments; and
      (G) whether the Congress should continue, modify, or terminate the program under this subsection.
    (13) The Secretary shall include in the annual report required under section 393(g) of this title the names of all accredited persons and the particular activities under this subsection for which each such person is accredited and the name of each accredited person whose accreditation has been withdrawn during the year.
    (14) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, this subsection does not have any legal effect on any agreement described in section 383(b) of this title between the Secretary and a foreign country.
