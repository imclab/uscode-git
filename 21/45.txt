   If, after an examination as provided in section 44 of this title, the tea is found by the examiner to be equal in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards provided in sections 41 to 44 of this title, and no reexamination shall be demanded by the collector as provided in section 47 of this title, a permit shall at once be granted to the importer or consignee declaring the tea free from the control of the customs authorities; but if on examination such tea, or merchandise described as tea, is found, in the opinion of the examiner, to be inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the said standards the importer or consignee shall be immediately notified, and the tea, or merchandise described as tea, shall not be released by the customhouse, unless on a reexamination called for by the importer or consignee the finding of the examiner shall be found to be erroneous. Should a portion of the invoice be passed by the examiner, a permit shall be granted for that portion and the remainder held for further examination, as provided in said section 47.
