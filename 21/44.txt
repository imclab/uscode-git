   On making entry at the customhouse of all teas, or merchandise described as tea, imported into the United States, the importer or consignee shall give a bond to the collector of the port that such merchandise shall not be removed from the warehouse until released by the collector, after it shall have been duly examined with reference to its purity, quality, and fitness for consumption. For the purpose of such examination samples of each line in every invoice of tea shall be submitted by the importer or consignee to the examiner, together with the sworn statement of such importer or consignee that such samples represent the true quality of each and every part of the invoice and accord with the specifications therein contained; or in the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, such samples shall be obtained by the examiner and compared by him with the standards established by this chapter. In cases where said tea, or merchandise described as tea, is entered at ports where there is no qualified examiner as provided in section 46 of this title, the consignee or importer shall in the manner aforesaid furnish under oath a sample of each line of tea to the collector or other revenue officer to whom is committed the collection of duties, and said officer shall also draw or cause to be drawn samples of each line in every invoice and shall forward the same to a duly qualified examiner as provided in said section. The bond required by this section shall also be conditioned for the payment of all customhouse charges which may attach to such merchandise prior to its being released or destroyed (as the case may be) under the provisions of this chapter.
