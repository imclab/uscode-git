  (a)    (1) Each officer who serves on a board convened under this chapter shall be an officer of the same armed force as the officer being required to show cause for retention on active duty.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), an officer may not serve on a board under this chapter unless such officer is serving on active duty in a grade above lieutenant colonel or commander and is senior in grade and rank to any officer considered by that board.
    (3) If qualified officers on active duty are not available in sufficient numbers to comprise a board convened under this chapter, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall complete the membership of the board by appointing retired officers of the same armed force who are retired in a grade above lieutenant colonel or commander and whose retired grade is senior to the grade of any officer considered by the board. A retired general or flag officer who is on active duty for the purpose of serving on a board convened under this chapter shall not, while so serving, be counted against any limitation on the number of general and flag officers who may be on active duty.
  (b) No person may be a member of more than one board convened under this chapter to consider the same officer.
