   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the promotion of a reserve officer under this chapter shall be made by a temporary appointment if the promotion of his running mate is made by a temporary appointment. If the running mateâ€œs temporary appointment is terminated for reasons other than disciplinary and he reverts to a lower grade, the temporary appointment of the reserve officer shall also be terminated and the reserve officer reverts to the same lower grade in the same manner as his running mate and with corresponding rank. If the running mate is permanently appointed in the grade in which he is serving under a temporary appointment, the reserve officer shall be permanently appointed in the grade in which he is serving under a temporary appointment.
