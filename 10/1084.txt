   A determination of dependency by an administering Secretary under this chapter is conclusive. However, the administering Secretary may change a determination because of new evidence or for other good cause. The Secretaryâ€œs determination may not be reviewed in any court or by the Comptroller General, unless there has been fraud or gross negligence.
