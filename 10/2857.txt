  (a) The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy would be practical and economically feasible.
  (b)    (1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy in those cases in which use of such forms of energy has the potential for reduced energy costs.
    (2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.
  (c)    (1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.
    (2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).
  (d) In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose. Any such increase under this subsection shall be in addition to any other administrative increase in cost per square foot or variation in floor area authorized by law.
