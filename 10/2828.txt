  (a)    (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of the military department concerned may lease housing facilities at or near a military installation in the United States, Puerto Rico, or Guam for assignment, without rental charge, as family housing to members of the armed forces and for assignment, with fair market rental charge, as family housing to civilian employees of the Department of Defense stationed at such installation.
    (2) A lease may only be made under paragraph (1) if the Secretary concerned finds that there is a shortage of adequate housing at or near such military installation and that–
      (A) the requirement for such housing is temporary;
      (B) leasing would be more cost effective than construction or acquisition of new housing;
      (C) family housing is required for personnel attending service school academic courses on permanent change of station orders;
      (D) construction of family housing at such installation has been authorized by law but is not yet completed; or
      (E) a military construction authorization bill pending in Congress includes a request for authorization of construction of family housing at such installation.
  (b)    (1) Not more than 10,000 family housing units may be leased at any one time under subsection (a).

    (4) At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary concerned shall adjust the maximum lease amount provided for under paragraphs (2) and (3) for the previous fiscal year by the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, during the preceding fiscal year exceeds such Consumer Price Index for the fiscal year before such preceding fiscal year.

    (2) The Secretary may enter into an agreement under this paragraph in connection with a lease entered into under subsection (c). Such an agreement–
      (A) shall be for the purpose of compensating a developer for any costs resulting from the termination of the lease during the construction of the housing units that are to be occupied pursuant to the lease;
