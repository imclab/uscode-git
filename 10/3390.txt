  (a) If an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States who is on active duty (other than for training) is recommended for promotion or becomes eligible for promotion under section 3389 of this title, an opportunity shall be given to the appropriate authority of the State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, as the case may be, to promote that officer to fill a vacancy in the Army National Guard of that jurisdiction. If necessary, a vacancy may be created for the purposes of this subsection.
  (b) If such an officer is so promoted in the Army National Guard, Federal recognition is extended to him effective as of the date on which he would have been promoted if he were an officer of the Army Reserve, and he may be promoted in his reserve grade effective as of the date of the extension of Federal recognition. However, if he is not so promoted in the Army National Guard, his Federal recognition in his reserve grade shall be withdrawn and he shall be transferred to the Army Reserve.
