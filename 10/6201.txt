Expenses incident to such care and treatment are chargeable to the same appropriation as would be chargeable for care and treatment in a naval hospital.
  (b) The deduction authorized by section 4812 of the Revised Statutes (24 U.S.C. 16) shall be made from accounts of members hospitalized under this section.
