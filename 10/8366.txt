The names of the officers to be considered shall include–

    (2) all service before June 15, 1933, as a commissioned officer in the federally recognized National Guard or in a federally recognized commissioned status in the National Guard, and in the National Guard after June 14, 1933, if his service therein was continuous from the date of his Federal recognition as an officer therein to the date of his appointment in the National Guard of the United States; and
    (3) all service credited to him under section 8353 of this title.
       No service may be counted more than once.
