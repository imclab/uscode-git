    (B) 100 percent of all clean claims must be processed not later than 100 days after the date that such claims are submitted to the claims processor.
  (2) The Secretary may, under the system required by paragraph (1) and consistent with the provisions in chapter 39 of title 31 (commonly referred to as the ””Prompt Payment Act““), require that interest be paid on clean claims that are not processed within 30 days.
  (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term ””clean claim““ means a claim that has no defect, impropriety (including a lack of any required substantiating documentation), or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment on the claim under this section.

In such case the contractor may begin to provide managed care support pursuant to the contract as soon as practicable after the award of the contract, but in no case later than one year after the date of such award.
  (2) A contractor under this paragraph is a contractor who is awarded a contract to provide managed care support under the TRICARE program–
    (A) who has not previously been awarded such a contract by the Department of Defense; or
