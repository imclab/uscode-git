  (a) If a reserve commissioned officer who is recommended for promotion to a reserve grade is not promoted because the President declines to appoint him, or because the Senate does not consent to his appointment after he has been nominated for appointment in a reserve general officer grade, he continues to be eligible as if he had not been considered for promotion and shall be considered by the next appropriate selection board considering officers of his grade. If he is recommended by the next selection board, his name shall be placed on the recommended list. If he is promoted on the recommendation of that board, he shall be credited with the same amount of service, computed under section 8360(e) of this title, in the grade to which promoted, that he would have had if he had been promoted as a result of his original selection.
  (b) An officer in the reserve grade of first lieutenant, captain, or major who is not promoted because the President declines to appoint him in the next higher grade, and who is not thereafter promoted becauseâ€“
    (1) he is considered by a selection board but is not recommended for promotion; or
    (2) the President again declines to appoint him in the next higher grade;
       shall be treated in the manner provided for deferred officers in section 8846 of this title.
