    (3) if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, holding the arraignment and receiving the pleas of the accused; and
    (4) performing any other procedural function which may be performed by the military judge under this chapter or under rules prescribed pursuant to section 836 of this title (article 36) and which does not require the presence of the members of the court.
       These proceedings shall be conducted in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel, and the trial counsel and shall be made a part of the record.
