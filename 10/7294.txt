   In case of a treaty for the limitation of naval armament to which the United States is a signatory, the President may suspend so much of the authorized naval construction as is necessary to bring the naval vessels of the United States within the limitations agreed upon. Such a suspension does not apply to vessels under construction at the time the suspension is made.
