The Secretary concerned may waive the limitations contained in the preceding sentence if (i) such Secretary determines that, considering the useful life of the structure to be improved and the useful life of a newly constructed unit and the cost of construction and of operation and maintenance of each kind of unit over its useful life, the improvement will be cost-effective, and (ii) a period of 21 days elapses after the date on which the Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and of the House of Representatives receive a notice from such Secretary of the proposed waiver, together with an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement will be cost effective.
