   Before any salvage vessel or salvage gear is sold, chartered, leased, lent, or otherwise transferred by the Department of the Navy to any private party, the transferee must agree in writing with the Department that the vessel or gear will be used to support organized offshore salvage facilities for a period of as many years as the Secretary considers appropriate. The agreement shall contain such other provisions as the Secretary considers appropriate to assure the fulfillment of the undertaking.
