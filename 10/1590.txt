  (a) The Secretary of Defense may, without regard to the provisions of any other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of employees–
    (1) establish such positions, including positions in the Senior Executive Service, for civilian intelligence officers and employees of the military departments as may be necessary to carry out the intelligence functions of such departments, except that the total number of positions in the Senior Executive Service established pursuant to this section may not exceed one-half of one percent of the total number of all civilian intelligence positions established pursuant to this section;
    (2) appoint individuals to such positions; and
    (3) fix the compensation of such individuals for service in such positions.
  (b) The Secretary of Defense shall, subject to subsection (c), fix the rates of basic pay for positions established under subsection (a) in relation to the rates of basic pay provided in the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5 for positions subject to such Schedule which have corresponding levels of duties and responsibilities. The Secretary shall also fix rates of pay for positions in the Senior Executive Service established pursuant to this section that are not in excess of the maximum rate or less than the minimum rate of basic pay established pursuant to section 5382 of title 5. Except in the case of a civilian intelligence officer or employee of a military department serving as a member of the Senior Executive Service of a military department, no civilian intelligence officer or employee of a military department may be paid basic pay at a rate in excess of the highest rate of basic pay payable under such General Schedule.
  (c) The Secretary of Defense is authorized, consistent with section 5341 of title 5, to adopt such provisions of such title as provide for prevailing rate systems of basic pay and to apply such provisions to positions for civilian intelligence officers or employees in or under which the military departments may employ individuals described by section 5342(a)(2)(A) of such title.
  (d) In addition to the basic pay payable under subsection (b), civilian intelligence officers and employees of the military departments who are citizens or nationals of the United States and who are stationed outside the continental United States or in Alaska may be paid allowances, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, not in excess of an allowance authorized to be paid by section 5941(a) of title 5 for employees whose rates of basic pay are fixed by statute. Such allowances shall be based on–
    (1) living costs substantially higher than in the District of Columbia;
    (2) conditions of environment which differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant an allowance as a recruitment incentive; or
    (3) both of the factors described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
  (e)    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Defense may terminate the employment of any civilian intelligence officer or employee of a military department whenever he considers that action to be in the interests of the United States and he determines that the procedures prescribed in other provisions of law that authorize the termination of the employment of such officer or employee cannot be invoked in a manner consistent with the national security. The decisions of the Secretary under this paragraph are final and may not be appealed or reviewed outside the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense shall promptly notify the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate whenever this termination authority is exercised.
    (2) Any termination of employment under this subsection shall not affect the right of the officer or employee involved to seek or accept employment with any other department or agency of the United States if he is declared eligible for such employment by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.
    (3) The Secretary of Defense may delegate authority under this subsection only to the Deputy Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned or both. An action to terminate any civilian intelligence officer or employee of a military department by either such officer shall be appealable to the Secretary of Defense.
  (f) With regard to any position in the Senior Executive Service which may be established pursuant to this section, the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to implement this section which are consistent with the requirements set forth in sections 3131, 3132(a)(2), 3393a, 3396(c), 3592, 3595(a), 5384, and 6304, subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 7543 (except that any hearing or appeal to which a member of the Senior Executive Service is entitled shall be held or decided pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary), and subchapter II of chapter 43 of title 5. The Secretary of Defense shall also prescribe, to the extent practicable, regulations to implement such other provisions of title 5 as apply to members of the Senior Executive Service or to individuals applying for positions in the Senior Executive Service.
  (g) The President, based on the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense, may award a rank referred to in section 4507 of title 5 to members of the Senior Executive Service whose positions may be established pursuant to this section. The awarding of such a rank shall be made in a manner consistent with the provisions of that section.
