      (B) any loan made under part D of such title (the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.);
      (C) any loan made under part E of such title (20 U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.); or
      (D) any loan incurred for educational purposes made by a lender that is–

           Repayment of any such loan shall be made on the basis of each complete year of service performed by the borrower.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense may repay loans described in paragraph (1) in the case of any person for service performed as a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of an armed force in a reserve component and in an officer program or military specialty specified by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary may repay such a loan only if the person to whom the loan was made performed such service after the loan was made.
  (b) The portion or amount of a loan that may be repaid under subsection (a) is 15 percent or $500, whichever is greater, for each year of service, plus the amount of any interest that may accrue during the current year.

  (f) The Secretary of Defense shall, by regulation, prescribe a schedule for the allocation of funds made available to carry out the provisions of this section and section 2171 of this title during any year for which funds are not sufficient to pay the sum of the amounts eligible for repayment under subsection (a) and section 2171(a) of this title.
  (g) The Secretary of Homeland Security may repay loans described in subsection (a)(1) and otherwise administer this section in the case of members of the Selected Reserve of the Coast Guard Reserve when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy.
