   An officer in the reserve grade of first lieutenant, captain, or major who is considered, but not recommended, by a selection board under section 3366 or 3367 of this title shall, if he remains in an active status, be placed on the next zone of consideration list established under either of those sections for the consideration of officers of his branch and grade. If he is again considered under section 3366 of this title and is recommended for promotion, he shall be promoted one year after the date on which he would have been promoted if he had been recommended by the board that first considered him. However, if, upon second consideration under either section, he is not recommended for promotion, he may not thereafter be considered for promotion or examined for Federal recognition and shall be treated as prescribed in section 3846 of this title.
