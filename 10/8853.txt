   For the purpose of determining whether a reserve commissioned officer may be transferred to the Retired Reserve, or discharged, under this chapter, his years of service are computed by addingâ€“
  (1) all service as a commissioned officer of any armed force; and
  (2) all service before June 15, 1933, as a commissioned officer in the federally recognized National Guard or in a federally recognized commissioned status in the National Guard, and in the National Guard after June 14, 1933, if his service therein was continuous from the date of his Federal recognition as an officer therein to the date of his appointment in the National Guard of the United States.
     No service may be counted more than once.
