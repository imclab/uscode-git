  (b) T4Determinations by InterpolationK.–If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in the table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.
  (c) T4Reallocations to Lower GradeK.–Whenever the number of members serving in pay grade E–9 for duty described in subsection (a) is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for pay grade E–8.
  (d) T4Secretarial WaiverK.–(1) Upon determining that it is in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Defense may increase for a particular fiscal year the number of reserve enlisted members that may be on active duty or full-time National Guard duty as described in subsection (a) for a reserve component in a pay grade referred to in a table in subsection (a) by a number that does not exceed the number equal to 5 percent of the maximum number specified for that grade and reserve component in the table.
  (2) Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority provided in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives notice in writing of the adjustment made.
  (e) T4Full-Time Reserve Component Duty DefinedK.–In this section, the term ””full-time reserve component duty““ has the meaning given the term in section 12011(e) of this title.
