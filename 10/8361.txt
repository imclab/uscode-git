  (a) For promotion purposes, reserve commissioned officers in any reserve grade are senior to those in any lower reserve grade.
  (b) Among reserve commissioned officers in the same reserve grade, seniority for promotion purposes is based on length of service in that grade computed under section 8360(e) of this title.
  (c) When seniority determined under subsection (b) is the same, seniority for promotion purposes is based on length of service computed under section 8366(e) of this title.
  (d) When seniority determined under subsection (c) is the same, the Secretary of the Air Force shall fix the seniority.
  (e) For promotion purposes, the years of service computed under section 8360(e) of this title of a reserve commissioned officer who is returned to an active status are reduced, so far as necessary, so that one year after the date on which he is returned to that status he will not have more than four years of that service if he is in the reserve grade of first lieutenant, or seven years of that service if he is in reserve grade of captain or major. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, such a reserve commissioned officer may not be considered for promotion until at least one year after the date on which he is returned to an active status.
