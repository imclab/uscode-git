  (a)    (1) A dependent described in paragraph (2) is entitled, upon request, to the medical and dental care prescribed by section 1077 of this title in facilities of the uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental staff.
    (2) A dependent referred to in paragraph (1) is a dependent of a member of a uniformed service–
      (A) who is on active duty for a period of more than 30 days or who died while on that duty; or
      (B) who died from an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated–
        (i) while on active duty under a call or order to active duty of 30 days or less, on active duty for training, or on inactive duty training; or
        (ii) while traveling to or from the place at which the member is to perform, or has performed, such active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training.
  (b) Under regulations to be prescribed jointly by the administering Secretaries, a dependent of a member or former member–
    (1) who is, or (if deceased) was at the time of his death, entitled to retired or retainer pay or equivalent pay; or
    (2) who died before attaining age 60 and at the time of his death (A) would have been eligible for retired pay under chapter 1223 of this title (or under chapter 67 of this title as in effect before the effective date of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act) but for the fact that he was under 60 years of age, and (B) had elected to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan established under subchapter II of chapter 73 of this title;
       may, upon request, be given the medical and dental care prescribed by section 1077 of this title in facilities of the uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental staff, except that a dependent of a member or former member described in clause (2) may not be given such medical or dental care until the date on which such member or former member would have attained age 60. A dependent described in section 1072(2)(F) of this title may be provided medical and dental care pursuant to clause (2) without regard to subclause (B) of such clause.

Care under this section may not be permitted to interfere with the primary mission of those facilities.
  (d) To utilize more effectively the medical and dental facilities of the uniformed services, the administering Secretaries shall prescribe joint regulations to assure that dependents entitled to medical or dental care under this section will not be denied equal opportunity for that care because the facility concerned is that of a uniformed service other than that of the member.
  (e)    (1) Subject to paragraph (3), if an abused dependent of a former member of a uniformed service described in paragraph (4) needs medical or dental care for an injury or illness resulting from abuse by the member, the administering Secretary may, upon request of the abused dependent, furnish medical or dental care to the dependent for the treatment of such injury or illness in facilities of the uniformed services.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (3), upon request of any dependent of a former member of a uniformed service punished for an abuse described in paragraph (4), the administering Secretary for such uniformed service may furnish medical care in facilities of the uniformed services to the dependent for the treatment of any adverse health condition resulting from such dependent“s knowledge of (A) the abuse, or (B) any injury or illness suffered by the abused person as a result of such abuse.
    (3) Medical and dental care furnished to a dependent of a former member of the uniformed services in facilities of the uniformed services under paragraph (1) or (2)–
      (A) shall be limited to the health care prescribed by section 1077 of this title;
      (B) shall be subject to the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental staff; and
      (C) shall terminate one year after the date on which the former member was discharged or dismissed from a uniformed service as described in paragraph (4).

        (ii) was administratively discharged from a uniformed service as a result of such an offense.
      (B) A determination of whether an offense involved abuse of a dependent of the member shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the administering Secretary for such uniformed service.
