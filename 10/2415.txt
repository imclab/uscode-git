   The Secretary shall allocate funds available for assistance under this chapter equally to each Department of Defense contract administrative services district. If in any such fiscal year there is an insufficient number of satisfactory proposals in a district for cooperative agreements to allow effective use of the funds allocated to that district, the funds remaining with respect to that district shall be reallocated among the remaining districts.
