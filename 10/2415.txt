   The Secretary shall allocate funds available for assistance under this chapter equally to each Defense Contract Administration Services region. If in any such fiscal year there is an insufficient number of satisfactory proposals in a region for cooperative agreements to allow effective use of the funds allocated to that region, the funds remaining with respect to that region shall be reallocated among the remaining regions.
