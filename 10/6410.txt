  (a) Whenever he determines that such action is necessary to provide a steady flow of promotion for officers in an active status in the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve, the Secretary of the Navy may convene a board to recommend an appropriate number of these officers for elimination from an active status. Subject to section 1005 \1\N of this title, officers so recommended may be eliminated from an active status as provided in subsection (b).
  (b) An officer who is to be eliminated from an active status under this section shall, if qualified, be given an opportunity to request transfer to the appropriate Retired Reserve and, if he requests it, shall be so transferred. If he is not transferred to the Retired Reserve, he shall, in the discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the appropriate inactive status list or be discharged from the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve.
