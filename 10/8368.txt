  (a) In this chapter, the term ””deferred officer““ means any of the following officers who has been considered, for the first time under this chapter, by a selection board for promotion to the next grade higher than his current reserve grade but not recommended for that promotion, who has been examined for the first time for Federal recognition in the next grade higher than his current reserve grade, but found not qualified for that recognition, or who has been recommended or found qualified and declined that promotion:
    (1) An officer in the reserve grade of first lieutenant or captain.
    (2) An officer in the reserve grade of major.
  (b) The years of service computed under sections 8360(e) and 8366(e) of this title, with which a deferred officer is credited shall be reduced, if necessary, so that one year after the date on which he would have been promoted if he had been recommended by a selection board he will not have more than four years of service computed under section 8360(e) of this title if he is in the reserve grade of first lieutenant, or seven years of that service if he is in the reserve grade of captain or major. For the purpose of this subsection, the date on which a deferred officer would have been promoted had he been recommended is the earlier of the following dates–
    (1) the earliest date of appointment in the next higher reserve grade of any officer who, before the deferred officer“s loss of seniority, was junior to him; or
    (2) the date on which he would have completed the amount of service prescribed in columns 2 and 3 of section 8366(a) of this title, if his years of service had not been reduced under this section.
  (c) Unless he is sooner recommended for promotion under section 8372 of this title or examined for Federal recognition in the next higher grade–
    (1) an officer who is deferred because he was considered but not recommended by a selection board shall be considered for promotion by the next selection board considering officers of his grade and category under section 8366 of this title; and
    (2) an officer who is deferred because he was found not qualified for Federal recognition shall be considered for promotion by the next appropriate selection board convened under section 8366 of this title when the officer next junior to him is also considered, but not before one year after the date on which he was found not qualified for Federal recognition.
  (d) An officer who is deferred because he was considered but not recommended by a selection board may, if he is appointed to the next higher grade in the Air National Guard, be examined for Federal recognition in that grade at any time before the date on which he must be considered for promotion under subsection (c)(1).
  (e) An officer who is deferred because he was found not qualified for Federal recognition in the next higher grade may be again examined for Federal recognition in that grade at any time before the date on which he must be considered for promotion under subsection (c)(2), but not before one year after the date on which he was first found not qualified for Federal recognition in that grade.
  (f) A deferred officer who is again considered for promotion under subsection (c)(1) and is not recommended for promotion, or is recommended and declines the promotion, may not thereafter be considered for promotion or examined for Federal recognition, and shall be treated as provided in section 8846(a) of this title and section 323(e) of title 32.
  (g) A deferred officer who is again considered for promotion or examined for Federal recognition in the next higher grade under subsection (c)(2), (d), or (e), and is not recommended for promotion or found qualified for Federal recognition, or is recommended or found qualified and declines the promotion, may not thereafter be considered for promotion or examined for Federal recognition, and shall be treated as provided in section 8846(b) of this title and section 323(e) of title 32.
