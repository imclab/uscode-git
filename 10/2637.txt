   The Secretary of Defense may authorize the commander of a unified combatant command to use Government owned or leased vehicles to provide transportation in an area outside the United States for members of the uniformed services and Federal civilian employees under the jurisdiction of that commander, and for the dependents of such members and employees, if the commander determines that public or private transportation in such area is unsafe or not available. Such transportation shall be provided in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.
