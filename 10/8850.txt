   Whenever the Secretary of the Air Force believes that there are too many commissioned officers in an active status, in any reserve grade, who have at least 30 years of service computed under section 8853 of this title or at least 20 years of service computed under section 1332 \1\N of this title, he may convene a board to consider all reserve officers in an active status in that grade who have that amount of service and who are not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit. The board shall recommend officers by name for removal from an active status, in the number specified by the Secretary. In the case of an officer so recommended, the Secretary mayâ€“
  (1) transfer him to the Retired Reserve, if he is qualified and applies therefor;
  (2) transfer him to an inactive status, if he is qualified; or
  (3) discharge him from his reserve appointment.
