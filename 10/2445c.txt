      (C) there has been a significant, adverse change in the expected performance of the major automated information system to be acquired under the program from the parameters originally submitted to Congress under paragraph (4) of section 2445b(b) of this title.
  (d) T4Report on Critical Changes in Program.–
    (1) T4In generalK.–If, based on a quarterly report submitted by the program manager of a major automated information system program pursuant to subsection (a), the senior Department of Defense official responsible for the program makes a determination described in paragraph (2), the official shall, not later than 60 days after receiving such report–

      (D) there has been a change in the expected performance of the major automated information system to be acquired under the program that will undermine the ability of the system to perform the functions anticipated at the time information on the program was originally submitted to Congress under section 2445b(b) of this title.
  (e) T4Program EvaluationK.–The evaluation of a major automated information system program conducted under this subsection for purposes of subsection (d)(1)(A) shall include an assessment of–

    (2) there is no alternative to the system which will provide equal or greater capability at less cost;
    (3) the new estimates of the costs, schedule, and performance parameters with respect to the program and system are reasonable; and
    (4) the management structure for the program is adequate to manage and control program costs.
  (g) T4Prohibition on Obligation of FundsK.–(1) If the determination of a critical change to a program is made by the senior Department official responsible for the program under subsection (d)(2) and a report is not submitted to Congress within the 60-day period provided by subsection (d)(1), appropriated funds may not be obligated for any major contract under the program.
  (2) The prohibition on the obligation of funds for a program under paragraph (1) shall cease to apply on the date on which Congress has received a report in compliance with the requirements of subsection (d)(2).
