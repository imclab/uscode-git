  (a) The Secretary concerned may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State under which the Secretary of State agrees to provide housing and related services for personnel under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned who are assigned to duty in a foreign country if the Secretary concerned determinesâ€“
    (1) that there is a shortage of adequate housing in the area of the foreign country in which such personnel are assigned to duty; and
    (2) that participation in the Department of State housing pool is the most cost-effective means of providing housing for such personnel.
       The Secretary concerned shall reimburse the Secretary of State, as provided in the agreement, for housing and related services furnished personnel under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned.
  (b) The maximum lease amounts specified in section 2828(e)(1) of this title for the rental of family housing in foreign countries shall not apply to housing made available to the Department of Defense under this section. To the extent that the lease amount for units of housing made available under this subsection exceeds such maximum lease amounts, such units shall not be counted in applying the limitation contained in such section on the number of units of family housing for which the Secretary concerned may waive such maximum lease amounts.
