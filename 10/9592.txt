   In the operation of telegraph lines, cables, or radio stations, members of the Air Force may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Air Force, collect forwarding charges due connecting commercial telegraph or radio companies for sending radiograms or telegrams over their lines. Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, they may present a voucher to a disbursing official for payment of the forwarding charge.
