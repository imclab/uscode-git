   A reserve officer who is recommended for promotion by a selection board convened under this chapter or under chapter 36 of this title, and who, at the time he would otherwise be promoted, is ineligible for promotion because he has been transferred to the inactive status list, shall be treated as if he had not been considered for promotion by the selection board that last considered him. If he is later returned to an active status, his name may not be placed on a promotion list for promotion to the next higher grade until he is considered by another selection board and is recommended for promotion in the approved report of that board.
