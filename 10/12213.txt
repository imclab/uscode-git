Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or section 593 \1\N of this title, an officer who is transferred under this section shall be advanced to the highest temporary, regular, or reserve grade ever held by him in the Army, unless the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interests of the service.
  (b) Unless discharged from his appointment as a Reserve, an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States whose Federal recognition as a member of the Army National Guard is withdrawn becomes a member of the Army Reserve. An officer who so becomes a member of the Army Reserve ceases to be a member of the Army National Guard of the United States.
