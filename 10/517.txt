  (a) Except as provided in section 307 of title 37, the authorized daily average number of enlisted members on active duty (other than for training) in an armed force in pay grades E–8 and E–9 in a calendar year may not be more than 2 percent (or, in the case of the Army, 2.5 percent) and 1 percent, respectively, of the number of enlisted members of that armed force who are on active duty (other than for training) on January 1 of that year. In computing the limitations prescribed in the preceding sentence, there shall be excluded enlisted members of an armed force on active duty (other than for training) in connection with organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the reserve component of an armed force.
  (b) Whenever the number of members serving in pay grade E–9 is less than the number authorized for that grade under subsection (a), the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under such subsection for pay grade E–8.
