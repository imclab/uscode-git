   In leasing waterfront property from a State or municipality, the Secretary of the Navy may provide in the lease, where it is required by state law or municipal charter, that, as part or all of the consideration, any improvements placed upon the property by the United States become the property of the lessor when the lease, including any renewal, ends.
