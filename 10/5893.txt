  (a) The Secretary of the Navy, or such other authority as he directs, shall appoint and convene selection boards, each consisting of at least five officers, to consider for promotion to the next higher gradeâ€“
    (1) officers of the Naval Reserve in each grade above ensign and below rear admiral; and
    (2) officers of the Marine Corps Reserve in each grade above second lieutenant and below major general.
  (b) At least half the members of each selection board convened under this section must be reserve officers so far as practicable. All members of each board must be serving in a grade above the grade in which the officers that are to be considered by the board are serving. An officer may not serve on two consecutive boards to consider officers for promotion to the same grade if the second of the two is to consider any officer who was considered and not recommended for promotion to that grade by the first board. Selection boards convened under this section may serve for as long as the Secretary prescribes, but not longer than one year.
  (c) Regardless of the number of officers appointed to a board under this section, five officers constitute a quorum. However, at least a majority of the total membership of the board must concur in each recommendation made by the board.
