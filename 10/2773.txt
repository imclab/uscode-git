      (A) to make payments as the agent of the disbursing official;
      (B) to sign checks drawn on disbursing accounts of the Secretary of the Treasury; and
      (C) to carry out other duties required under law.
    (2) The penalties for misconduct that apply to a disbursing official apply to a deputy disbursing official designated under this subsection.
  (b)    (1) If a disbursing official of any military department dies, becomes disabled, or is separated from office, a deputy disbursing official may continue the accounts and payments in the name of the former disbursing official until the last day of the 2d month after the month in which the death, disability, or separation occurs. The accounts and payments shall be allowed, audited, and settled as provided by law.
