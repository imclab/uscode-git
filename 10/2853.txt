  (c) The limitation on cost variations in subsection (a) or the limitation on scope reduction in subsection (b)(1) does not apply if the variation in cost or reduction in the scope of work is approved by the Secretary concerned and–
    (1) in the case of a cost increase or a reduction in the scope of work–
      (A) the Secretary concerned notifies the appropriate committees of Congress in writing of the cost increase or reduction in scope and the reasons therefor, including a description of the funds proposed to be used to finance any increased costs; and
      (B) a period of 21 days has elapsed after the date on which the notification is received by the committees or, if over sooner, a period of 14 days has elapsed after the date on which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title; or
    (2) in the case of a cost decrease, the Secretary concerned notifies the appropriate committees of Congress in writing not later than 14 days after the date funds are obligated in connection with the military construction project or military family housing project.

    (2) The costs associated with the required remediation of an environmental hazard in connection with a military construction project or military family housing project, such as asbestos removal, radon abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, or any other legally required environmental hazard remediation, if the required remediation could not have reasonably been anticipated at the time the project was approved originally by Congress.
