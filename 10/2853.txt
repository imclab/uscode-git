    (1) the increase in cost or reduction in scope is approved by the Secretary concerned;
    (2) the Secretary concerned notifies the appropriate committees of Congress in writing of the increase or reduction and the reasons therefor; and
    (3) a period of 21 days has elapsed after the date on which the notification is received by the committees.
  (d) The limitation on cost increases in subsection (a) does not apply to a within-scope modification to a contract or to the settlement of a contractor claim under a contract if the increase in cost is approved by the Secretary concerned, and the Secretary concerned promptly submits written notification of the facts relating to the proposed increase in cost to the appropriate committees of Congress.
