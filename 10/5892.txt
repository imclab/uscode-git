   Each year the Secretary of the Navy shall prescribe the number of officers in each grade in the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve that may be promoted in that year to the next higher grade under this chapter. He shall prescribe for each grade the number that he determines to be necessary to provideâ€“
  (1) equitable opportunity for promotion among succeeding groups of reserve officers; and
  (2) an adequate continuing strength of reserve officers in an active status.
     However, the Secretary may not prescribe numbers that will cause the number of reserve officers in an active status holding permanent appointments in any grade to exceed the number authorized for that grade in section 5457 \1\N or section 5458 \1\ of this title. With respect to the numbers of reserve officers in the staff corps that may be promoted, the Secretary shall prescribe numbers that will cause the relationship between line and staff corps officers in an active status in the Naval Reserve to conform to that established by the Secretary for regular line and staff corps officers on the active-duty list under other provisions of this title.
