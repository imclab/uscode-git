   If a cemetery on a military reservation, including an installation cemetery, has been or is to be discontinued, the Secretary concerned may provide for the removal of remains from that cemetery to any other cemetery. With respect to any deceased member of an armed force under his jurisdiction whose last service terminated honorably by death or otherwise, the Secretary may also provide for the removal of the remains from a place of temporary interment, or from an abandoned grave or cemetery, to a national cemetery.
