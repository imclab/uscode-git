   The President may award an Air Force cross of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force, distinguishes himself by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a medal of honorâ€“
  (1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;
  (2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or
  (3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.
