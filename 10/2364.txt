    (2) among Defense research facilities and other offices, agencies, and bureaus in the Department that are engaged in related technological matters.
  (b) T4Functions of Defense Research FacilitiesK.–The Secretary of Defense shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable–
    (1) that Defense research facilities are assigned broad mission requirements rather than specific hardware needs;
    (2) that appropriate personnel of such facilities are assigned to serve as consultants on component and support system standardization;
    (3) that the managers of such facilities have broad latitude to choose research and development projects;
    (4) that technology position papers prepared by Defense research facilities are readily available to all combatant commands and to contractors who submit bids or proposals for Department of Defense contracts; and
    (5) that, in order to promote increased consideration of technological issues early in the development process, any position paper prepared by a Defense research facility on a technological issue relating to a major weapon system, and any technological assessment made by such facility in the case of such component, is made a part of the records considered for the purpose of making milestone O, milestone I, and milestone II decisions.
