      (C) suspension from duty under section 155(f)(2) or 164(g) of this title; or

    (2) Service in a joint duty assignment outside the United States or in Alaska or Hawaii which is less than the applicable standard prescribed in subsection (a).
    (3) Service in a joint duty assignment in a case in which–
      (A) the officer“s tour of duty in that assignment brings the officer“s cumulative service for purposes of subsection (f)(3) to the applicable standard prescribed in subsection (a); and
      (B) the length of time served in that assignment (in any case other than an assignment which is described in subsection (g)(4)(B)) was not less than two years.
  (e) T4Average Tour LengthsK.–(1) The Secretary shall ensure that the average length of joint duty assignments during any fiscal year (after fiscal year 1990), measured by the lengths of the joint duty assignments ending during that fiscal year, meets the standards prescribed in subsection (a).
  (2) In computing the average length of joint duty assignments for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary may exclude the following service:
    (A) Service described in subsection (c), except that not more than 12\1/2\ percent of all joint duty assignments shown on the list published pursuant to section 668(b)(2)(A) of this title may be so excluded in any year.
    (B) Service described in subsection (d).
  (f) T4Full Tour of DutyK.–An officer shall be considered to have completed a full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment upon completion of–
    (1) a joint duty assignment that meets the standards prescribed in subsection (a);
    (2) a joint duty assignment under the circumstances described in subsection (c);
    (3) cumulative service in joint duty assignments as described in subsection (g);
    (4) a joint duty assignment outside the United States or in Alaska or Hawaii for which the normal accompanied-by-dependents tour of duty is prescribed by regulation to be at least two years in length, if the officer serves in the assignment for a period equivalent to the accompanied-by-dependents tour length (except that not more than 6 percent of all joint duty assignments may be considered to be under this paragraph at any time); or
    (5) a joint duty assignment with respect to which the Secretary of Defense has granted a waiver under subsection (b), but only in a case in which the Secretary determines that the service completed by that officer in that duty assignment shall be considered to be a full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment.
  (g) T4Cumulative CreditK.–(1) Cumulative service for purposes of subsection (f)(3) is service in joint duty assignments which totals in length not less than the applicable standard prescribed in subsection (a) and which includes at least one tour of duty in a joint duty assignment that–
    (A) was performed outside the United States or in Alaska or Hawaii; or
    (B) was terminated because of a qualifying reassignment (as described in paragraph (4)).
  (2) In computing cumulative service of an officer in joint duty assignments for purposes of paragraph (1), a tour of duty of the officer in a joint duty assignment other than a tour of duty specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) may not be counted unless the officer served at least two years in the assignment. The prohibition on counting certain tours of duty in the preceding sentence does not apply to a joint duty assignment which follows a reassignment described in paragraph (4)(B).
  (3) In computing the cumulative service of an officer in joint duty assignments for purposes of paragraph (1), a tour of duty in a joint duty assignment shall be excluded if the officer served less than 10 months in that assignment.
  (4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a qualifying reassignment is a reassignment of an officer from a joint duty assignment–
    (A) for unusual personal reasons (including extreme hardship and medical conditions) beyond the control of the officer or the armed forces; or
    (B) to another joint duty assignment immediately after–
      (i) the officer was promoted to a higher grade if the reassignment was made because no joint duty assignment was available within the same organization that was commensurate with the officer“s new grade; or
      (ii) the officer“s position was eliminated in a reorganization.
  (h) T4Constructive CreditK.–(1) The Secretary of Defense may accord constructive credit in the case of an officer (other than a general or flag officer) who, for reasons of military necessity, is reassigned from a joint duty assignment within 60 days of meeting the tour length criteria prescribed in subsection (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(4), or (g)(2). The amount of constructive service that may be credited to such officer shall be the amount sufficient for the completion of the applicable tour of duty requirement, but in no case more than 60 days.
  (2) For the purpose of computing under subsection (e) the average length of joint duty assignments during a fiscal year, the amount of any constructive service credited under this subsection with respect to a joint duty assignment to be counted in that computation shall be excluded.
  (3) This subsection shall not apply in the case of an officer who serves less than 10 months in the joint duty assignment.
