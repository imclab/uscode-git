If the total number of commissioned officers serving on active duty in an armed force (excluding officers in categories specified in subsection (b)) is greater or less than the figures listed in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in that table in the same proportion as reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.
  (b) Officers in the following categories shall be excluded in computing and determining authorized strengths under this section:
    (1) Reserve officers–
      (A) on active duty for training;
      (B) on active duty under section 10211, 10302 through 10305, or 12402 of this title or under section 708 of title 32;

  (c) Whenever the number of officers serving in any grade is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for any lower grade.
  (d) An officer may not be reduced in grade, or have his pay or allowances reduced, because of a reduction in the number of commissioned officers authorized for his grade under this section.
