    (3) If the total number of commissioned officers serving on active duty in an armed force (excluding officers in categories specified in subsection (b)) is between any two consecutive figures listed in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that armed force are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of commissioned officers serving on active duty in an armed force (excluding officers in categories specified in subsection (b)) is greater or less than the figures listed in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in that table in the same proportion as reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.
  (b) Officers in the following categories shall be excluded in computing and determining authorized strengths under this section:
    (1) Reserve officers–
      (A) on active duty as authorized under section 115(a)(1)(B) or 115(b)(1) of this title, or excluded from counting for active duty end strengths under section 115(i) of this title;

      (C) on full-time National Guard duty.
    (2) General and flag officers.
    (3) Medical officers.
    (4) Dental officers.
    (5) Warrant officers.

    (8) Permanent professors of the United States Military Academy and the United States Air Force Academy and professors of the United States Naval Academy who are career military professors (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy), but not to exceed 50 from any such academy.
  (c) Whenever the number of officers serving in any grade is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for any lower grade.
  (d) An officer may not be reduced in grade, or have his pay or allowances reduced, because of a reduction in the number of commissioned officers authorized for his grade under this section.
