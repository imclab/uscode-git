  (b) T4Removal for Withholding of Senate Advice and ConsentK.–If the Senate does not give its advice and consent to the appointment to the next higher grade of an officer whose name is on a list of officers approved by the President for promotion (except in the case of promotions to a reserve grade to which appointments may be made by the President alone), the name of that officer shall be removed from the list.
  (c) T4Continued Eligibility for PromotionK.–An officer whose name is removed from a list under subsection (a) or (b) continues to be eligible for consideration for promotion.
