   If a dependent covered by a plan under section 1079 of this title needs hospitalization beyond the time limits in that plan, and if the hospitalization is authorized in medical facilities of the uniformed services, he may be transferred to such a facility for additional hospitalization. If transfer is not feasible, the expenses of additional hospitalization in the civilian facility may be paid under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe after consulting the other administering Secretaries.
