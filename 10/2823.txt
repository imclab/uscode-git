  (c) If the Secretary concerned and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development agree that suitable alternative housing is available at a location at which military family housing units are authorized to be constructed, the Secretary may not proceed with such construction.
  (d) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define what constitutes suitable alternative housing for the purposes of this section.
