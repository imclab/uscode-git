  (c)    (1) If, after reviewing the record of the case of any officer, a board of review determines that the officer has established that he should be retained on active duty, the officerâ€œs case is closed.
    (2) An officer who is required to show cause for retention under subsection (a) of section 1181 of this title and who is determined under paragraph (1) to have established that he should be retained on active duty may not again be required to show cause for retention under such subsection within the one-year period beginning on the date of that determination.
    (3)      (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an officer who is required to show cause for retention under subsection (b) of section 1181 of this title and who is determined under paragraph (1) to have established that he should be retained on active duty may again be required to show cause for retention at any time.
      (B) An officer who has been required to show cause for retention as a result of proceedings under subsection (b) of section 1181 of this title and who is thereafter retained on active duty may not again be required to show cause for retention on active duty under such subsection solely because of conduct which was the subject of the previous proceeding, unless the findings or recommendations of the board of inquiry or board of review that considered his case are determined to have been obtained by fraud or collusion.
