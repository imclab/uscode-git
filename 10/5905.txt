  (a) The President may remove the name of any reserve officer from a promotion list established under this chapter. Such action may be taken at any time before the promotion of the officer.  
  (b) The name of a reserve officer selected under this chapter for promotion to a grade above captain in the Navy or above colonel in the Marine Corps shall be removed from the promotion list if the Senate rejects his appointment to the grade for which he has been recommended.  
  (c) An officer whose name is removed from a promotion list under subsection (a) or (b) continues to be eligible for consideration for promotion. If he is recommended for promotion by the next selection board, and the report of the board is approved by the President, his name shall be placed on the promotion list without prejudice and, if he is promoted, he shall have the same date of rank that he would have had if this name had not been removed. However, if the officer is not recommended for promotion in the approved report of the next selection board, or if he is so recommended but the President removes his name from the promotion list or the Senate rejects his appointment, he is considered for all purposes as having twice failed of selection for promotion.
