  (2) Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense under subsection (b) of section 3716 of title 31–
    (A) shall include provisions to carry out paragraph (1); and
    (B) shall provide the carrier for a claim subject to paragraph (1) with an opportunity to offer an alternative method of repaying the claim (rather than by administrative offset) if the collection of the claim by administrative offset has not already been made.
  (3) In this subsection, the term ””simplified acquisition threshold““ has the meaning given that term in section 4(11) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(11)).
