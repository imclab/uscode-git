  (a) No more than one medal of honor, Air Force cross, or distinguished-service medal may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of such a medal or cross, the President may award a suitable bar or other device to be worn as he directs.  
  (b) Except as provided in subsection (d), no medal of honor, Air Force cross, distinguished-service medal, or device in place thereof, may be awarded to a person unless–  
    (1) the award is made within three years after the date of the act justifying the award;  
    (2) a statement setting forth the distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made within two years after the distinguished service; and  
    (3) it appears from records of the Department of the Air Force that the person is entitled to the award.  
  (c) No medal of honor, Air Force cross, distinguished-service medal, or device in place thereof, may be awarded or presented to a person whose service after he distinguished himself has not been honorable.  
  (d) If the Secretary of the Air Force determines that–  
    (1) a statement setting forth the distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made and supported by sufficient evidence within two years after the distinguished service; and  
    (2) no award was made, because the statement was lost or through inadvertence the recommendation was not acted on;  
       a medal of honor, Air Force cross, distinguished-service medal, or device in place thereof, as the case may be, may be awarded to the person concerned within two years after the date of that determination.
