   The Postal Service may enter into special contracts with any carrier or person, without advertising, for bids and for periods not in excess of 4 years. It may contract to pay lower rates or compensation or, where in its judgment conditions warrant, higher rates or compensation than those determined or fixed by the Board. The fact that the Board has not prescribed rates or compensation for the carrier involved, under section 5207 of this title, shall not preclude execution of a contract under this section. Such contracts may be negotiated only after reasonable notice has been posted in advance in post offices on the post roads to be served, and other carriers or persons have been given an opportunity to offer to negotiate for the transportation of mail.
