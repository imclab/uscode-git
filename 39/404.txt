    (2) to prescribe, in accordance with this title, the amount of postage and the manner in which it is to be paid;
    (3) to determine the need for post offices, postal and training facilities and equipment, and to provide such offices, facilities, and equipment as it determines are needed;
    (4) to provide and sell postage stamps and other stamped paper, cards, and envelopes and to provide such other evidences of payment of postage and fees as may be necessary or desirable;

    (9) to authorize the issuance of a substitute check for a lost, stolen, or destroyed check of the Postal Service.
  (b)    (1) The Postal Service, prior to making a determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section as to the necessity for the closing or consolidation of any post office, shall provide adequate notice of its intention to close or consolidate such post office at least 60 days prior to the proposed date of such closing or consolidation to persons served by such post office to ensure that such persons will have an opportunity to present their views.
    (2) The Postal Service, in making a determination whether or not to close or consolidate a post office, shall consider–
      (A) the effect of such closing or consolidation on the community served by such post office;
      (B) the effect of such closing or consolidation on employees of the Postal Service employed at such office;
      (C) whether such closing or consolidation is consistent with the policy of the Government, as stated in section 101(b) of this title, that the Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining;
      (D) the economic savings to the Postal Service resulting from such closing or consolidation; and

The Commission shall review such determination on the basis of the record before the Postal Service in the making of such determination. The Commission shall make a determination based upon such review no later than 120 days after receiving any appeal under this paragraph.
