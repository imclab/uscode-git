The Board shall publish its orders stating its determination under this section which shall remain in force until changed by it after notice and hearing.
  (b) For the purpose of determining and fixing rates or compensation under this section, the Board may make just and reasonable classifications of carriers and, where just and equitable, fix general rates applicable to carriers in the same classification.
  (c) In determining and fixing fair and reasonable rates or compensation under this section, the Board shall consider the relation between the Government and carriers as public service corporations, and the nature of public service as distinguished, if there is a distinction, from the ordinary transportation business of the carriers.
  (d) Initial rates or compensation for mail transportation service by any carrier or carriers shall be those agreed to by the Postal Service and the carrier or carriers, and such rates or compensation shall continue in effect until such time as the Board fixes the rates or compensation under subsection (a) of this section.
