    (1) General requirements
       The Administrator is authorized and directed to establish and conduct at locations throughout the Nation a lake water quality demonstration program. The program shall, at a minimum–
      (A) develop cost effective technologies for the control of pollutants to preserve or enhance lake water quality while optimizing multiple lakes uses;
      (B) control nonpoint sources of pollution which are contributing to the degradation of water quality in lakes;
      (C) evaluate the feasibility of implementing regional consolidated pollution control strategies;
      (D) demonstrate environmentally preferred techniques for the removal and disposal of contaminated lake sediments;
      (E) develop improved methods for the removal of silt, stumps, aquatic growth, and other obstructions which impair the quality of lakes;
      (F) construct and evaluate silt traps and other devices or equipment to prevent or abate the deposit of sediment in lakes; and
      (G) demonstrate the costs and benefits of utilizing dredged material from lakes in the reclamation of despoiled land.
    (2) Geographical requirements
       Demonstration projects authorized by this subsection shall be undertaken to reflect a variety of geographical and environmental conditions. As a priority, the Administrator shall undertake demonstration projects at Lake Champlain, New York and Vermont; Lake Houston, Texas; Beaver Lake, Arkansas; Greenwood Lake and Belcher Creek, New Jersey; Deal Lake, New Jersey; Alcyon Lake, New Jersey; Gorton“s Pond, Rhode Island; Lake Washington, Rhode Island; Lake Bomoseen, Vermont; Sauk Lake, Minnesota; and Lake Worth, Texas.
