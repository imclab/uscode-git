   When an officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government authorized to receive, redeem, or cancel Treasury notes receives or pays a note that was stolen and put in circulation after it had been received or redeemed by an officer, employee, or agent authorized to receive or redeem the note, the Secretary of the Treasury may allow the officer, employee, or agent receiving or paying the stolen note a credit for the amount of the note. The Secretary may allow the credit only if the Secretary is satisfied that the note was received or paid in good faith and in exercising ordinary prudence.
