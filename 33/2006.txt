   Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
   In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:
  (a) By all vessels:
    (i) the state of visibility;
    (ii) the traffic density including concentration of fishing vessels or any other vessels;
    (iii) the maneuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;
    (iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shores lights or from back scatter of her own lights;
    (v) the state of wind, sea, and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;
    (vi) the draft in relation to the available depth of water.
  (b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:
    (i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;
    (ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;
    (iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather, and other sources of interference;
    (iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;
    (v) the number, location, and movement of vessels detected by radar; and
    (vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.
