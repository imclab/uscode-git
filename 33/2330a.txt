    (1) include a description of the monitoring activities to be carried out, the criteria for ecosystem restoration success, and the estimated cost and duration of the monitoring; and
    (2) specify that the monitoring shall continue until such time as the Secretary determines that the criteria for ecosystem restoration success will be met.
