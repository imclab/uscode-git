   When the authorization of a project of river and harbor improvement requires that local interests shall contribute a specific sum of money toward its cost, the Secretary of the Army, upon the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, may reduce the sum to be contributed to an amount which shall be in the same ratio to the amount of the required contribution as the actual cost of the work to which said contribution is applicable bears to its original estimated cost as set forth in the project document.
