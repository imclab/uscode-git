  (b) In a place without a depositary, the Secretary, on deciding it is essential to the public interest, may authorize specially in writing that public money be–

    (2) kept in another manner under regulations the Secretary decides are the safest and most effective in making a payment to a public creditor easier.
  (c) A disbursing official is not liable for an overpayment provided under a United States Government bill of lading or transportation request when the overpayment is caused by the–
    (1) use of improper transportation rates or classifications; or

      (B) an equalization or other agreement.
