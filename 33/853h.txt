  (a) Authorization of payment
     An officer who is separated under section 853g of this title and who has completed more than three years of continuous active service immediately before that separation is entitled to separation pay computed under subsection (b) of this section unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the conditions under which the officer is separated do not warrant payment of that pay.
  (b) Amount of pay; five or more years; three to five years
    (1) In the case of an officer who has completed five or more years of continuous active service immediately before that separation, the amount of separation pay which may be paid to the officer under this section is 10 percent of the product of (A) the years of active service creditable to the officer, and (B) twelve times the monthly basic pay to which the officer was entitled at the time of separation.
    (2) In the case of an officer who has completed three but fewer than five years of continuous active service immediately before that separation, the amount of separation pay which may be paid to the officer under this section is one-half of the amount computed under paragraph (1).
  (c) Determination of officer“s years of service
     In determining an officer“s years of active service for the purpose of computing separation pay under this section, each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the officer is counted as one-twelfth of a year and any remaining fractional part of a month is disregarded.
  (d) Previously received pay excluded from determination of years of creditable service
     A period for which an officer has previously received separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay under any other provision of law based on service in a uniformed service may not be included in determining the years of creditable service that may be counted in computing the separation pay of the officer under this section.
  (e) Deduction from retired pay of amount of prior payments; deduction from disability compensation of amount of separation pay; exception
    (1) An officer who has received separation pay under this section, or separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay under any other provision of law, based on service in a uniformed service and who later qualifies for retired pay under this Act shall have deducted from each payment of retired pay so much of that pay as is based on the service for which the officer received that separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay until the total amount deducted is equal to the total amount of separation pay, severance pay, and readjustment pay received.
    (2) An officer who has received separation pay under this section may not be deprived, by reason of receipt of that pay, of any disability compensation to which the officer is entitled under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but there shall be deducted from that disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay received, less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay (such withholding being at the flat withholding rate for Federal income tax withholding, as in effect pursuant to regulations prescribed under chapter 24 of title 26). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no deduction may be made from disability compensation for the amount of separation pay received because of an earlier discharge, separation, or release from a period of active duty if the disability which is the basis for that disability compensation was incurred or aggravated during a later period of active duty.
