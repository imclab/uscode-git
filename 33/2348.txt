    (3) be required to make a determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval for the project.
  (f) State authority
     If the coordinated review process is being implemented under this section by the Secretary with respect to the development of a water resources project described in subsection (b) within the boundaries of a State, the State, consistent with State law, may choose to participate in the process and to make subject to the process all State agencies that–

    (2) are required to conduct or issue a review, analysis, or opinion for the project; or
    (3) are required to make a determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval for the project.
  (g) Memorandum of understanding
     The coordinated review process developed under this section may be incorporated into a memorandum of understanding for a water resources project between the Secretary, the heads of Federal, State, and local government agencies, Indian tribes identified under subsection (e), and the non-Federal interest for the project.
  (h) Effect of failure to meet deadline
    (1) Notification

    (3) Report to Congress
       Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of a report under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall compile and submit a report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, and the Council on Environmental Quality, describing any deadlines identified in paragraph (1), and any information provided to the Secretary by the Federal, State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest involved under paragraph (2).
