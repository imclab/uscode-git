    (1) In general
       In carrying out this section, the National Weather Service, in consultation with other relevant Administration offices, shall–
      (A) develop requirements for the equipment used to forecast tsunami, which shall include provisions for multipurpose detection platforms, reliability and performance metrics, and to the maximum extent practicable how the equipment will be integrated with other United States and global ocean and coastal observation systems, the global earth observing system of systems, global seismic networks, and the Advanced National Seismic System;
      (B) develop and execute a plan for the transfer of technology from ongoing research described in section 3205 of this title into the program under this section; and
      (C) ensure that maintaining operational tsunami detection equipment is the highest priority within the program carried out under this chapter.
    (2) Report to Congress
      (A) Not later than 1 year after January 12, 2007, the National Weather Service, in consultation with other relevant Administration offices, shall transmit to Congress a report on how the tsunami forecast system under this section will be integrated with other United States and global ocean and coastal observation systems, the global earth observing system of systems, global seismic networks, and the Advanced National Seismic System.
      (B) Not later than 3 years after January 12, 2007, the National Weather Service, in consultation with other relevant Administration offices, shall transmit a report to Congress on how technology developed under section 3205 of this title is being transferred into the program under this section.
  (f) Federal cooperation
     When deploying and maintaining tsunami detection technologies, the Administrator shall seek the assistance and assets of other appropriate Federal agencies.
  (g) Annual equipment certification
     At the same time Congress receives the budget justification documents in support of the President“s annual budget request for each fiscal year, the Administrator shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives a certification that–
    (1) identifies the tsunami detection equipment deployed pursuant to this chapter, as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year;
    (2) certifies which equipment is operational as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year;
    (3) in the case of any piece of such equipment that is not operational as of such date, identifies that equipment and describes the mitigation strategy that is in place–
