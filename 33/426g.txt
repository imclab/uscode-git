      (B) Determination of feasibility
         A project under the demonstration program shall not be carried out until the Secretary determines that the project is feasible.
      (C) Emphasis
         A project under the demonstration program shall emphasize, to the maximum extent practicable–
        (i) the development and demonstration of innovative technologies;
        (ii) efficient designs to prevent erosion at a shoreline site, taking into account the lifecycle cost of the design, including cleanup, maintenance, and amortization;
        (iii) new and enhanced shore protection project design and project formulation tools the purposes of which are to improve the physical performance, and lower the lifecycle costs, of the projects;
        (iv) natural designs, including the use of native and naturalized vegetation or temporary structures that minimize permanent structural alterations to the shoreline;
        (v) the avoidance of negative impacts to adjacent shorefront communities;
        (vi) in areas with substantial residential or commercial interests located adjacent to the shoreline, designs that do not impair the aesthetic appeal of the interests;
        (vii) the potential for long-term protection afforded by the technology; and
        (viii) recommendations developed from evaluations of the program established under the Shoreline Erosion Control Demonstration Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962–5 \2\N note),\2\ including–
          (I) adequate consideration of the subgrade;
          (II) proper filtration;
          (III) durable components;
          (IV) adequate connection between units; and
          (V) consideration of additional relevant information.
      (D) Sites
        (i) In general
           Each project under the demonstration program may be carried out at–
          (I) a privately owned site with substantial public access; or
          (II) a publicly owned site on open coast or in tidal waters.
        (ii) Selection
           The Secretary shall develop criteria for the selection of sites for projects under the demonstration program, including criteria based on–
          (I) a variety of geographic and climatic conditions;
          (II) the size of the population that is dependent on the beaches for recreation or the protection of private property or public infrastructure;
          (III) the rate of erosion;
          (IV) significant natural resources or habitats and environmentally sensitive areas; and
          (V) significant threatened historic structures or landmarks.
    (3) Consultation
       The Secretary shall carry out the demonstration program in consultation with–
      (A) the Secretary of Agriculture, particularly with respect to native and naturalized vegetative means of preventing and controlling shoreline erosion;
      (B) Federal, State, and local agencies;
      (C) private organizations;
      (D) the Coastal Engineering Research Center established by section 426–1 of this title; and
      (E) applicable university research facilities.
    (4) Completion of demonstration
       After carrying out the initial construction and evaluation of the performance and cost of a project under the demonstration program, the Secretary may–
      (A) amend, at the request of a non-Federal interest of the project, the partnership agreement for a federally authorized shore protection project in existence on the date on which initial construction of the project under the demonstration program is complete to incorporate the project constructed under the demonstration program as a feature of the shore protection project, with the future cost sharing of the project constructed under the demonstration program to be determined by the project purposes of the shore protection project; or
      (B) transfer all interest in and responsibility for the completed project constructed under the demonstration program to a non-Federal interest or another Federal agency.
    (5) Agreements
       The Secretary may enter into a partnership agreement with the non-Federal interest or a cooperative agreement with the head of another Federal agency under the demonstration program–
      (A) to share the costs of construction, operation, maintenance, and monitoring of a project under the demonstration program;
      (B) to share the costs of removing the project, or element of the project if the Secretary determines that the project or element of the project is detrimental to public or private property, public infrastructure, or public safety; or
      (C) to specify ownership of the completed project if the Secretary determines that the completed project will not be part of a Corps of Engineers project.
    (6) Report
       Not later than December 31, 2008, and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report describing–
