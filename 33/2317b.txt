  (1) In general
     In carrying out a water resources project that involves wetlands mitigation and that has impacts that occur within the service area of a mitigation bank, the Secretary, where appropriate, shall first consider the use of the mitigation bank if the bank contains sufficient available credits to offset the impact and the bank is approved in accordance with the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use and Operation of Mitigation Banks (60 Fed. Reg. 58605) or other applicable Federal law (including regulations).
  (2) Service area
     To the maximum extent practicable, the service area of the mitigation bank under paragraph (1) shall be in the same watershed as the affected habitat.
  (3) Responsibility for monitoring
    (A) In general
       Purchase of credits from a mitigation bank for a water resources project relieves the Secretary and the non-Federal interest from responsibility for monitoring or demonstrating mitigation success.
    (B) Applicability
       The relief of responsibility under subparagraph (A) applies only in any case in which the Secretary determines that monitoring of mitigation success is being conducted by the Secretary or by the owner or operator of the mitigation bank.
