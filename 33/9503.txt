  (a) A Government pension plan is subject to section 103 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1023) in the same way that an employee pension benefit plan is subject to section 103. However, section 103 applies to a Government pension plan for officers or employees of the Central Intelligence Agency only if the President specifically approves application of the requirements of section 103 in writing. In applying section 103 to a Government pension plan–
    (1) the annual report shall be–
      (A) in the form and include information the President, in consultation with the Comptroller General, prescribes or, if the pension plan is referred to in section 9502(1)(B)(iv)–(vii) or (ix) of this title, the Comptroller General prescribes; and
      (B) submitted to Congress and to the Comptroller General by the end of the 210-day period beginning on the day after the last day of the plan year involved;
    (2) a provision providing for waiver of, relief from, or exception to a requirement otherwise applicable to an employee pension benefit plan applies to a Government pension plan only if specifically authorized by the Comptroller General;
    (3) section 104(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1024(b)) does not apply;
    (4) the report required by this chapter is in addition to other reports or projections required by law; and
    (5) except for a Government pension plan referred to in section 9502(1)(B)(iv)–(vii) of this title, the Comptroller General shall conduct audits when appropriate instead of complying with the requirements for the independent qualified public accountant.
  (b) This chapter does not prevent a Government pension plan from using the services of an enrolled actuary employed by an agency administering the plan.
