   Not later than January 15, 1988, and each January 15 thereafter, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report whichâ€“
  (1) specifies the amount of electricity generated by each water resource project constructed by the Secretary which generated electricity in the preceding fiscal year;
  (2) specifies the revenues received by the United States from the sale of electricity generated by such project; and
  (3) specifies the costs of construction, operation, and maintenance of such project allocated to the generation of electricity.
     In carrying out the study under this section, the Secretary shall compare the actual amount of capital costs repaid to that amount that would be required to repay capital costs. The first report submitted under this section shall specify the amounts of electricity generated, the revenues received, and the costs allocated for each such project before October 1, 1985, on a fiscal year basis in constant dollars. Each report thereafter shall specify the amounts of electricity generated, the revenues received, and the costs allocated for each such project for the preceding fiscal year.
