  (a) An audit conducted in accordance with this chapter shall be in lieu of any financial or financial and compliance audit of an individual Federal assistance program which a State or local government is required to conduct under any other Federal law or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation, a Federal agency shall rely upon and use that information and plan and conduct its own audits accordingly in order to avoid a duplication of effort.
  (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal agency shall conduct any additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation. The provisions of this chapter do not authorize any State or local government (or subrecipient thereof) to constrain, in any manner, such agency from carrying out such additional audits.
  (c) The provisions of this chapter do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or enter into contracts for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal financial assistance programs, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official.
  (d) Subsection (a) shall apply to a State or local government which conducts an audit in accordance with this chapter even though it is not required by section 7502(a) to conduct such audit.
  (e) A Federal agency that performs or contracts for audits in addition to the audits conducted by recipients pursuant to this chapter shall, consistent with other applicable law, arrange for funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional audits include economy and efficiency audits, program results audits, and program evaluations.
