         The non-Federal share of the costs of developing and implementing a monitoring and notification program may be–
        (i) in an amount not to exceed 50 percent, as determined by the Administrator in consultation with State, tribal, and local government representatives; and

     As a condition of receipt of a grant under subsection (b) of this section, a State or local government program for monitoring and notification under this section shall identify–
    (1) lists of coastal recreation waters in the State, including coastal recreation waters adjacent to beaches or similar points of access that are used by the public;
    (2) in the case of a State program for monitoring and notification, the process by which the State may delegate to local governments responsibility for implementing the monitoring and notification program;
    (3) the frequency and location of monitoring and assessment of coastal recreation waters based on–
      (A) the periods of recreational use of the waters;
      (B) the nature and extent of use during certain periods;
      (C) the proximity of the waters to known point sources and nonpoint sources of pollution; and
      (D) any effect of storm events on the waters;
    (4)      (A) the methods to be used for detecting levels of pathogens and pathogen indicators that are harmful to human health; and
