  (a) Overtaking vessel to keep out of the overtaken vesselâ€œs way
     Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 4 through 18, any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.
  (b) Overtaking vessel defined
     A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam; that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.
  (c) Assumption that vessel is overtaking another in cases of doubt
     When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.
  (d) Overtaking vessel to become crossing vessel only when finally past and clear
     Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.
