  (a) In general
     In any fiscal year in which the Administrator has available for obligation at least $1,350,000,000 for the purposes of section 1381 of this title–
    (1) the Administrator may make grants to States for the purpose of providing grants to a municipality or municipal entity for planning, design, and construction of treatment works to intercept, transport, control, or treat municipal combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows; and
    (2) subject to subsection (g) of this section, the Administrator may make a direct grant to a municipality or municipal entity for the purposes described in paragraph (1).
  (b) Prioritization
     In selecting from among municipalities applying for grants under subsection (a) of this section, a State or the Administrator shall give priority to an applicant that–
    (1) is a municipality that is a financially distressed community under subsection (c) of this section;
    (2) has implemented or is complying with an implementation schedule for the nine minimum controls specified in the CSO control policy referred to in section 1342(q)(1) of this title and has begun implementing a long-term municipal combined sewer overflow control plan or a separate sanitary sewer overflow control plan;
    (3) is requesting a grant for a project that is on a State“s intended use plan pursuant to section 1386(c) of this title; or
    (4) is an Alaska Native Village.
  (c) Financially distressed community
    (1) Definition
       In subsection (b) of this section, the term ””financially distressed community““ means a community that meets affordability criteria established by the State in which the community is located, if such criteria are developed after public review and comment.
    (2) Consideration of impact on water and sewer rates
       In determining if a community is a distressed community for the purposes of subsection (b) of this section, the State shall consider, among other factors, the extent to which the rate of growth of a community“s tax base has been historically slow such that implementing a plan described in subsection (b)(2) of this section would result in a significant increase in any water or sewer rate charged by the community“s publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.
    (3) Information to assist States
       The Administrator may publish information to assist States in establishing affordability criteria under paragraph (1).
  (d) Cost-sharing
     The Federal share of the cost of activities carried out using amounts from a grant made under subsection (a) of this section shall be not less than 55 percent of the cost. The non-Federal share of the cost may include, in any amount, public and private funds and in-kind services, and may include, notwithstanding section 1383(h) of this title, financial assistance, including loans, from a State water pollution control revolving fund.
  (e) Administrative reporting requirements
     If a project receives grant assistance under subsection (a) of this section and loan assistance from a State water pollution control revolving fund and the loan assistance is for 15 percent or more of the cost of the project, the project may be administered in accordance with State water pollution control revolving fund administrative reporting requirements for the purposes of streamlining such requirements.
