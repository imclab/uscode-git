  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds the following:
    (1) Antifouling paints containing organotin biocides are used to prevent the build-up of barnacles and other encrusting organisms on vessels.
    (2) Laboratory and field studies show that organotin is very toxic to marine and freshwater organisms at very low levels.
    (3) Vessels that are less than 25 meters in length and are coated with organotin antifouling paint account for a large amount of the organotin released into the aquatic environment.
    (4) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that concentrations of organotin currently in the waters of the United States may pose unreasonable risks to oysters, clams, fish, and other aquatic life.
  (b) Purpose
     The purpose of this chapter is to protect the aquatic environment by reducing immediately the quantities of organotin entering the waters of the United States.
