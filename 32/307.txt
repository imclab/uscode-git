    (1) receive an appointment with a view to filling a vacancy in a federally recognized unit or organization of the National Guard;
    (2) have the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary concerned for the grade, branch, position, and type of unit or organization involved; and
    (3) except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, pass an examination for physical, moral, and professional fitness to be prescribed by the President, and subscribe to the oath of office prescribed by section 312 of this title.
  (b) The examination prescribed by subsection (a)–
    (1) shall be conducted, for the Army National Guard, by a board of three commissioned officers designated by the Secretary of the Army from members of the Regular Army or the Army National Guard of the United States, or both, and for the Air National Guard, by a board of three commissioned officers designated by the Secretary of the Air Force from members of the Regular Air Force or the Air National Guard of the United States, or both; and
    (2) may be held before original appointment or promotion.
  (c) If such a board finds a person qualified, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau may issue to him a certificate of eligibility for Federal recognition for the office for which he was found qualified.
