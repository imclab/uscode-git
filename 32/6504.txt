   Notwithstanding a law of the United States providing that one State agency or multimember agency must be established or designated to carry out or supervise the administration of a grant program, the head of the executive agency carrying out the program may, when requested by the executive or legislative authority of the State responsible for the organizational structure of a State governmentâ€“
  (1) waive the one State agency or multimember agency provision on an adequate showing that the provision prevents the establishment of the most effective and efficient organizational arrangement within the State government; and
  (2) approve another State administrative structure or arrangement after deciding that the objectives of the law authorizing the grant program will not be endangered by using another State structure or arrangement.
