    (3) Transactions selected from Federal assistance programs, other than major Federal assistance programs, pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) shall be tested for compliance with Federal laws and regulations that apply to such transactions. Any noncompliance found in such transactions by the independent auditor in making determinations required by this paragraph shall be reported.
    (4) The number of transactions selected and tested under paragraphs (2) and (3), the selection and testing of such transactions, and the determinations required by such paragraphs shall be based on the professional judgment of the independent auditor.
    (5) A series of audits of individual departments, agencies, and establishments for the same fiscal year may be considered to be an audit for the purpose of this chapter.

      (A) if the subrecipient conducts an audit in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, review such audit and ensure that prompt and appropriate corrective action is taken on instances of material noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to Federal financial assistance provided to the subrecipient by the State or local government; or
      (B) if the subrecipient does not conduct an audit in accordance with the requirements of this chapter–
        (i) determine whether the expenditures of Federal financial assistance provided to the subrecipient by the State or local government are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and
        (ii) ensure that prompt and appropriate corrective action is taken on instances of material noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to Federal financial assistance provided to the subrecipient by the State or local government.
    (2) Each such State and local government shall require each subrecipient of Federal assistance through such government to permit, as a condition of receiving funds from such assistance, the independent auditor of the State or local government to have such access to the subrecipient“s records and financial statements as may be necessary for the State or local government to comply with this chapter.
  (f) The report made on any audit conducted pursuant to this section shall, within thirty days after completion of such report, be transmitted to the appropriate Federal officials and made available by the State or local government for public inspection.
  (g) If an audit conducted pursuant to this section finds any material noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations by, or material weakness in the internal controls of, the State or local government with respect to the matters described in subsection (d)(2), the State or local government shall submit to appropriate Federal officials a plan for corrective action to eliminate such material noncompliance or weakness or a statement describing the reasons that corrective action is not necessary. Such plan shall be consistent with the audit resolution standard promulgated by the Comptroller General (as part of the standards for internal controls in the Federal Government) pursuant to section 3512(c) of this title.
