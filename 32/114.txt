  (a) Subject to such regulations and restrictions as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the performance of honor guard functions by members of the National Guard at funerals for veterans of the armed forces may be treated by the Secretary concerned as a Federal function for which appropriated funds may be used. Any such performance of honor guard functions at such a funeral may not be considered to be a period of drill or training otherwise required.
  (b) This section does not authorize additional appropriations for any fiscal year. Any expense of the National Guard that is incurred by reason of this section shall be paid from appropriations otherwise available for the National Guard.
