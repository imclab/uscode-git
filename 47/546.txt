    (2) Any final decision by a franchising authority under this subsection shall be made in a public proceeding. Such decision shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the franchising authority, unless such 120 day period is extended by mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising authority.

      (B) the terms of the modification requested are appropriate because of commercial impracticability.

     Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may, upon 30 days“ advance notice to the franchising authority, rearrange, replace, or remove a particular cable service required by the franchise if–

     Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may take such actions to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service, if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title.
  (e) Requirements for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access
     A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section of any requirement for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access.
