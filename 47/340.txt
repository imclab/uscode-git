  (a) Significantly viewed stations
     In addition to the broadcast signals that subscribers may receive under section \1\N 338 and 339 of this title, a satellite carrier is also authorized to retransmit to a subscriber located in a community the signal of any station located outside the local market in which such subscriber is located, to the extent such signal–
    (1) has, before December 8, 2004, been determined by the Federal Communications Commission to be a signal a cable operator may carry as significantly viewed in such community, except to the extent that such signal is prevented from being carried by a cable system in such community under the Commission“s network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; or
    (2) is, after December 8, 2004, determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed in such community in accordance with the same standards and procedures concerning shares of viewing hours and audience surveys as are applicable under the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Commission to determining with respect to a cable system whether signals are significantly viewed in a community.
  (b) Limitations
    (1) Analog service limited to subscribers taking local-into-local service
       With respect to a signal that originates as an analog signal of a network station, this section shall apply only to retransmissions to subscribers of a satellite carrier who receive retransmissions of a signal that originates as an analog signal of a local network station from that satellite carrier pursuant to section 338 of this title.
    (2) Digital service limitations
       With respect to a signal that originates as a digital signal of a network station, this section shall apply only if–
      (A) the subscriber receives from the satellite carrier pursuant to section 338 of this title the retransmission of the digital signal of a network station in the subscriber“s local market that is affiliated with the same television network; and
      (B) either–
        (i) the retransmission of the local network station occupies at least the equivalent bandwidth as the digital signal retransmitted pursuant to this section; or
        (ii) the retransmission of the local network station is comprised of the entire bandwidth of the digital signal broadcast by such local network station.
    (3) Limitation not applicable where no network affiliates
       The limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission under this section to a subscriber located in a local market in which there are no network stations affiliated with the same television network as the station whose signal is being retransmitted pursuant to this section.
    (4) Authority to grant station-specific waivers
       Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission of a network station to a subscriber if and to the extent that the network station in the local market in which the subscriber is located, and that is affiliated with the same television network, has privately negotiated and affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of paragraph \2\N (1) and (2) to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of the significantly viewed station to such subscriber.
  (c) Publication and modifications of lists; regulations
    (1) In general
