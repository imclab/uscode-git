      (A) identify gaps in such service through a method of geographic information system mapping of service availability based on the geographic boundaries of where service is available or unavailable among residential or business customers; and
      (B) provide a baseline assessment of statewide broadband deployment in terms of households with high-speed availability.
  (f) Participation limit
