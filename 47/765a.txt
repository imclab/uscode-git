  (a) Limitations on signatories
    (1) National security limitations
       The Federal Communications Commission, after a public interest determination, in consultation with the executive branch, may restrict foreign ownership of a United States signatory if the Commission determines that not to do so would constitute a threat to national security.
    (2) No signatories required
       The United States Government shall not require signatories to represent the United States in INTELSAT or Inmarsat or in any successor entities after a pro-competitive privatization is achieved consistent with sections 763, 763a, and 763c of this title.
  (b) Clarification of privileges and immunities of COMSAT
    (1) Generally not immunized

    (3) No joint or several liability
       If COMSAT is found liable for any action taken in its status as a signatory or a representative of the party to INTELSAT, any such liability shall be limited to the portion of the judgment that corresponds to COMSATâ€œs percentage of the ownership of INTELSAT at the time the activity began which lead to the liability.
    (4) Provisions prospective
       Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to liability for any action taken by COMSAT before March 17, 2000.
  (c) Parity of treatment
