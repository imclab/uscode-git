    (1) Rural systems
       Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a local exchange carrier (with respect to a cable system located in its telephone service area) and a cable operator (with respect to the facilities of a local exchange carrier used to provide telephone exchange service in its cable franchise area) may obtain a controlling interest in, management interest in, or enter into a joint venture or partnership with the operator of such system or facilities for the use of such system or facilities to the extent that–

    (3) Acquisitions in competitive markets
       Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a local exchange carrier may obtain a controlling interest in, or form a joint venture or other partnership with, or provide financing to, a cable system (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as ””the subject cable system““), if–
      (A) the subject cable system operates in a television market that is not in the top 25 markets, and such market has more than 1 cable system operator, and the subject cable system is not the cable system with the most subscribers in such television market;

      (C) the subject cable system is not owned by or under common ownership or control of any one of the 50 cable system operators with the most subscribers as such operators existed on May 1, 1995; and
      (D) the system with the most subscribers in the television market is owned by or under common ownership or control of any one of the 10 largest cable system operators as such operators existed on May 1, 1995.
    (4) Exempt cable systems
       Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to any cable system if–
      (A) the cable system serves no more than 17,000 cable subscribers, of which no less than 8,000 live within an urban area, and no less than 6,000 live within a nonurbanized area as of June 1, 1995;

    (6) Waivers
       The Commission may waive the restrictions of subsections \1\N (a), (b), or (c) of this section only if–
      (A) the Commission determines that, because of the nature of the market served by the affected cable system or facilities used to provide telephone exchange service–
        (i) the affected cable operator or local exchange carrier would be subjected to undue economic distress by the enforcement of such provisions;
        (ii) the system or facilities would not be economically viable if such provisions were enforced; or
        (iii) the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served; and
      (B) the local franchising authority approves of such waiver.
  (e) ””Telephone service area““ defined
     For purposes of this section, the term ””telephone service area““ when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within which such carrier provided telephone exchange service as of January 1, 1993, but if any common carrier after such date transfers its telephone exchange service facilities to another common carrier, the area to which such facilities provide telephone exchange service shall be treated as part of the telephone service area of the acquiring common carrier and not of the selling common carrier.
