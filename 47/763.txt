   The President and the Commission shall secure a pro-competitive privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat that meets the criteria set forth in this section and sections 763a through 763c of this title. In securing such privatizations, the following criteria shall be applied as licensing criteria for purposes of part A of this subchapter:
  (1) Dates for privatization

    (A) INTELSAT as soon as practicable, but no later than April 1, 2001; and
    (B) Inmarsat as soon as practicable, but no later than July 1, 2000.
  (2) Independence
     The privatized successor entities and separated entities of INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall operate as independent commercial entities, and have a pro-competitive ownership structure. The successor entities and separated entities of INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall conduct an initial public offering in accordance with paragraph (5) to achieve such independence. Such offering shall substantially dilute the aggregate ownership of such entities by such signatories or former signatories. In determining whether a public offering attains such substantial dilution, the Commission shall take into account the purposes and intent, privatization criteria, and other provisions of this subchapter, as well as market conditions. No intergovernmental organization, including INTELSAT or Inmarsat, shall have–
    (A) an ownership interest in INTELSAT or the successor or separated entities of INTELSAT; or
    (B) more than minimal ownership interest in Inmarsat or the successor or separated entities of Inmarsat.

    (A) privileged or immune treatment by national governments;
    (B) privileges or immunities or other competitive advantages of the type accorded INTELSAT and Inmarsat and their signatories through the terms and operation of the INTELSAT Agreement and the associated Headquarters Agreement and the Inmarsat Convention; and
    (C) preferential access to orbital locations.
     Access to new, or renewal of access to, orbital locations shall be subject to the legal or regulatory processes of a national government that applies due diligence requirements intended to prevent the warehousing of orbital locations.
  (4) Prevention of expansion during transition
     During the transition period prior to privatization under this subchapter, INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall be precluded from expanding into additional services.

      (i) shall be conducted, for the successor entities of INTELSAT, on or about December 31, 2003, except that the Commission may extend this deadline in consideration of market conditions and relevant business factors relating to the timing of an initial public offering, but such extensions shall not permit such offering to be conducted later than June 30, 2004; and
      (ii) shall be conducted, for the successor entities of Inmarsat, not later than June 30, 2004, except that the Commission may extend this deadline to not later than December 31, 2004.
