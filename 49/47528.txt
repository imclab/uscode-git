  (b) T4WaiversK.–(1) If, not later than July 1, 1999, at least 85 percent of the aircraft used by an air carrier to provide air transportation comply with the stage 3 noise levels, the carrier may apply for a waiver of subsection (a) of this section for the remaining aircraft used by the carrier to provide air transportation. The application must be filed with the Secretary not later than January 1, 1999, and must include a plan with firm orders for making all aircraft used by the carrier to provide air transportation comply with the noise levels not later than December 31, 2003.

The schedule for phased-in compliance shall be based on–
    (1) a detailed economic analysis of the impact of the phaseout date for stage 2 aircraft on competition in the airline industry, including–
      (A) the ability of air carriers to achieve capacity growth consistent with the projected rate of growth for the airline industry;
      (B) the impact of competition in the airline and air cargo industries;
      (C) the impact on nonhub and small community air service; and
      (D) the impact on new entry into the airline industry; and

  (2)    (A) An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not operate in Hawaii, or between a place in Hawaii and a place outside the 48 contiguous States, a greater number of stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds than it operated in Hawaii, or between a place in Hawaii and a place outside the 48 contiguous States, on November 5, 1990.

  (3) An air carrier may provide turnaround service in Hawaii using stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds only if the carrier provided the service on November 5, 1990.
