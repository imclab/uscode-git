   Under regulations the Secretary of Transportation prescribes, each owner or operator of a gas pipeline facility shall carry out a program to educate the public on the use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation, the possible hazards associated with gas leaks, and the importance of reporting gas odors and leaks to the appropriate authority. The Secretary may develop material suitable for use in the program.
