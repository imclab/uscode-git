  (a) T4Uniformity of RegulationsK.–The Secretary of Transportation may not prescribe a safety regulation related to a motor vehicle subject to subchapter I of chapter 135 of this title that differs from a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter.

  (b) T4PreemptionK.–(1) When a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter, a State or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter. However, the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the otherwise applicable standard under this chapter.
  (2) A State may enforce a standard that is identical to a standard prescribed under this chapter.
  (c) T4Antitrust LawsK.–This chapter does not–

  (e) T4Common Law LiabilityK.–Compliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.
