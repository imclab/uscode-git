   Congress finds thatâ€“
  (1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;
  (2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;
  (3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;
  (4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;
  (5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility fees, for noise management;
  (6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;
  (7) revenues derived from a passenger facility fee may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and
  (8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility fee is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.
