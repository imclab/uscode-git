  (a) T4Negotiable BillsK.–(1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the bill–
    (A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a consignee; and
    (B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper that the bill is not negotiable.
  (2) Inserting in a negotiable bill of lading the name of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods–
    (A) does not limit its negotiability; and
    (B) is not notice to the purchaser of the goods of a right the named person has to the goods.
  (b) T4Nonnegotiable BillsK.–(1) A bill of lading is nonnegotiable if the bill states that the goods are to be delivered to a consignee. The indorsement of a nonnegotiable bill does not–
    (A) make the bill negotiable; or
    (B) give the transferee any additional right.
  (2) A common carrier issuing a nonnegotiable bill of lading must put ””nonnegotiable““ or ””not negotiable““ on the bill. This paragraph does not apply to an informal memorandum or acknowledgment.
