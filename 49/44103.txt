    (A) register the aircraft; and
    (B) issue a certificate of registration to its owner.
  (2) The Administrator may prescribe the extent to which an aircraft owned by the holder of a dealer“s certificate of registration issued under section 44104(2) of this title also is registered under this section.
  (b) T4Controlled Substance ViolationsK.–(1) The Administrator may not issue an owner“s certificate of registration under subsection (a)(1) of this section to a person whose certificate is revoked under section 44106 of this title during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the revocation, except–
    (A) as provided in section 44106(e)(2) of this title; or
    (B) that the Administrator may issue the certificate to the person after the one-year period beginning on the date of the revocation if the Administrator decides that the aircraft otherwise meets the requirements of section 44102 of this title and that denial of a certificate for the 5-year period–
