    (1) T4In generalK.–The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall take all necessary action to ensure that–
      (A) explosive detection systems are deployed as soon as possible to ensure that all United States airports described in section 44903(c) have sufficient explosive detection systems to screen all checked baggage no later than December 31, 2002, and that as soon as such systems are in place at an airport, all checked baggage at the airport is screened by those systems; and
      (B) all systems deployed under subparagraph (A) are fully utilized; and
      (C) if explosive detection equipment at an airport is unavailable, all checked baggage is screened by an alternative means.
