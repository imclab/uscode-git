    (2) the person has the right to transfer the bill and the title to the goods described in the bill;
    (3) the person does not know of a fact that would affect the validity or worth of the bill; and
    (4) the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular purpose when merchantability or fitness would have been implied if the agreement of the parties had been to transfer the goods without a bill of lading.
  (b) T4Security for DebtK.–A person holding a bill of lading as security for a debt and in good faith demanding or receiving payment of the debt from another person does not warrant by the demand or receipt–

  (c) T4DuplicatesK.–A common carrier issuing a bill of lading, on the face of which is the word ””duplicate““ or another word indicating that the bill is not an original bill, is liable the same as a person that represents and warrants that the bill is an accurate copy of an original bill properly issued. The carrier is not otherwise liable under the bill.
  (d) T4Indorser LiabilityK.–Indorsement of a bill of lading does not make the indorser liable for failure of the common carrier or a previous indorser to fulfill its obligations.
