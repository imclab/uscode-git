      (A) the total land area of the State (in square miles); multiplied by
      (B) 370; multiplied by
      (C)        (i) the population of the State in urbanized areas; divided by
        (ii) the total population of the State.
    (3) T4State apportionment factorK.–For each State qualifying for an apportionment under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall calculate an amount equal to the difference between the total population of the State less the amount calculated in paragraph (2).

    (5) T4Apportionments among urbanized areas in each stateK.–The Secretary shall apportion amounts made available to each State under paragraph (4) so that each urbanized area receives an amount equal to the amount apportioned under paragraph (4) multiplied by a ratio equal to the population of each urbanized area divided by the sum of populations of all urbanized areas in the State. Amounts apportioned to each urbanized area shall be added to amounts apportioned to that urbanized area under section 5336, and made available for grants under section 5307.
