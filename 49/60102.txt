  (b) T4Gathering LinesK.–(1)(A) Not later than October 24, 1994, the Secretary shall prescribe standards defining the term ””gathering line““.
  (B) In defining ””gathering line““ for gas, the Secretary–
    (i) shall consider functional and operational characteristics of the lines to be included in the definition; and
    (ii) is not bound by a classification the Commission establishes under the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.).

In defining the term, the Secretary shall consider factors such as location, length of line from the well site, operating pressure, throughput, and the composition of the transported gas or hazardous liquid, as appropriate, in deciding on the types of lines that functionally are gathering but should be regulated under this chapter because of specific physical characteristics.
    (B)      (i) The Secretary also shall consider diameter when defining ””regulated gathering line““ for hazardous liquid.
      (ii) The definition of ””regulated gathering line““ for hazardous liquid may not include a crude oil gathering line that has a nominal diameter of not more than 6 inches, is operated at low pressure, and is located in a rural area that is not unusually sensitive to environmental damage.
