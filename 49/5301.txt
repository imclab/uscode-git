  (a) T4Development of Transportation SystemsK.–It is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems that embrace various modes of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of individuals and goods in and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.
  (b) T4General FindingsK.–Congress finds that–
    (1) more than 70 percent of the population of the United States is located in rapidly expanding urban areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into at least 2 States;
    (2) the welfare and vitality of urban areas, the satisfactory movement of people and goods within those areas, and the effectiveness of programs aided by the United States Government are jeopardized by deteriorating or inadequate urban transportation service and facilities, the intensification of traffic congestion, and the lack of coordinated, comprehensive, and continuing development planning;
    (3) transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society, and the health and welfare of an urbanized society depend on providing efficient, economical, and convenient transportation in and between urban areas;
    (4) for many years the mass transportation industry capably and profitably satisfied the transportation needs of the urban areas of the United States but in the early 1970“s continuing even minimal mass transportation service in urban areas was threatened because maintaining that transportation service was financially burdensome;
    (5) ending that transportation, or the continued increase in its cost to the user, is undesirable and may affect seriously and adversely the welfare of a substantial number of lower income individuals;
    (6) some urban areas were developing preliminary plans for, or carrying out, projects in the early 1970“s to revitalize their mass transportation operations;
    (7) significant mass transportation improvements are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States;
    (8) financial assistance by the Government to develop efficient and coordinated mass transportation systems is essential to solve the urban transportation problems referred to in clause (2) of this subsection; and
    (9) immediate substantial assistance by the Government is needed to enable mass transportation systems to continue providing vital transportation service.
  (c) T4Rapid Urbanization and Continuing Population DispersalK.–Rapid urbanization and continuing dispersal of the population and activities in urban areas have made the ability of all citizens to move quickly and at a reasonable cost an urgent problem of the Government.
  (d) T4Elderly Individuals and Individuals With DisabilitiesK.–It is the policy of the Government that elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities have the same right as other individuals to use mass transportation service and facilities. Special efforts shall be made in planning and designing mass transportation service and facilities to ensure that mass transportation can be used by elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. All programs of the Government assisting mass transportation shall carry out this policy.
  (e) T4Preserving the EnvironmentK.–It is the policy of the Government that special effort shall be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside, public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and important historical and cultural assets when planning, designing, and carrying out an urban mass transportation capital project with assistance from the Government under sections 5309 and 5310 of this title.
  (f) T4General PurposesK.–The purposes of this chapter are–
    (1) to assist in developing improved mass transportation equipment, facilities, techniques, and methods with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;
    (2) to encourage the planning and establishment of areawide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirable urban development with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;
    (3) to assist States and local governments and their authorities in financing areawide urban mass transportation systems that are to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as decided by local needs;
    (4) to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their authorities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals; and
    (5) to establish a partnership that allows a community, with financial assistance from the Government, to satisfy its urban mass transportation requirements.
