Upon identifying such areas, the Secretaries may determine if the current level of regulation is sufficient to minimize the potential for unplanned losses of pipeline capacity.
  (b) T4ConsultationK.–In preparing any analysis under this section, the Secretaries may consult with the heads of other government agencies and public- and private-sector experts in pipeline and other forms of petroleum product transportation, energy consumption, pipeline capacity, population, and economic development.
