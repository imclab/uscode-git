  (a) T4Insurance and ReinsuranceK.–(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section and section 44305(a) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may provide insurance and reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of an American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft–
    (A) in foreign air commerce; or
    (B) between at least 2 places, all of which are outside the United States.
  (2) An aircraft may be insured or reinsured for not more than its reasonable value as determined by the Secretary. Insurance or reinsurance may be provided only when the Secretary decides that the insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from an insurance carrier.
  (b) T4Presidential ApprovalK.–The Secretary may provide insurance or reinsurance under subsection (a) of this section only with the approval of the President. The President may approve the insurance or reinsurance only after deciding that the continued operation of the American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft to be insured or reinsured is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States Government.
  (c) T4ConsultationK.–The President may require the Secretary to consult with interested departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government before providing insurance or reinsurance under this chapter.
  (d) T4Additional InsuranceK.–With the approval of the Secretary, a person having an insurable interest in an aircraft may insure with other underwriters in an amount that is more than the amount insured with the Secretary. However, the Secretary may not benefit from the additional insurance. This subsection does not prevent the Secretary from making contracts of coinsurance.
