  (b) T4Period of AvailabilityK.–An amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title is available to be obligated for grants under the apportionment only during the fiscal year for which the amount was apportioned and the 2 fiscal years immediately after that year or the 3 fiscal years immediately following that year in the case of a primary airport that had less than .05 percent of the total boardings in the United States in the preceding calendar year. If the amount is not obligated under the apportionment within that time, it shall be added to the discretionary fund.
  (c) T4Primary AirportsK.–(1) An amount apportioned to a sponsor of a primary airport under section 47114(c)(1) of this title is available for grants for any public-use airport of the sponsor included in the national plan of integrated airport systems.

    (A) At least 31 percent for grants for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2) of this title and for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c) of this title. The Secretary may count the amount of grants made for such planning and programs with funds apportioned under section 47114 in that fiscal year in determining whether or not such 31 percent requirement is being met in that fiscal year.
    (B) At least 4 percent for each fiscal year thereafter to sponsors of current or former military airports designated by the Secretary under section 47118(a) of this title for grants for developing current and former military airports to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system and to sponsors of noncommercial service airports for grants for operational and maintenance expenses at any such airport if the amount of such grants to the sponsor of the airport does not exceed $30,000 in that fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that the airport is adversely affected by the closure or realignment of a military base, and if the sponsor of the airport certifies that the airport would otherwise close if the airport does not receive the grant.
  (2) If the Secretary decides that an amount required to be used for grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection cannot be used for a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications, the amount the Secretary determines cannot be used is available during the fiscal year for grants for other airports or for other purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.

  (2) The Secretary may make a grant under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the Secretary decides that–
    (A) the total amount used for grants for the fiscal year under section 48103 of this title will not be more than the amount made available under section 48103 for that fiscal year; and
    (B) the amounts authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title for later fiscal years are sufficient for grants of the apportioned amounts that were not used for grants under the apportionment during the fiscal year and that remain available under subsection (b) of this section.
  (h) T4Limiting Authority of SecretaryK.–The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.
