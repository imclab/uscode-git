    (3) T4Assurance of accessK.–If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport.

      (A) result in an increase in the total number of slots per day at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport;
      (B) result in an increase in the total number of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from 7:00 ante meridiem to 9:59 post meridiem;
      (C) increase the number of operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in any 1-hour period by more than 2 operations;

    (1) T4Matters to be consideredK.–The Secretary shall continue the Secretary“s current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of–
      (A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;
      (B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:
        (i) congestion and delay in any part of the national aviation system;

      (C) the impact of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter;
      (D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;
      (E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;
      (F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;
      (G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and
      (H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O“Hare International Airport.
