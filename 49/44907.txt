   The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall continue in effect the requirement of section 129.25 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, that a foreign air carrier must adopt and use a security program approved by the Administrator. The Administrator may approve a security program of a foreign air carrier under section 129.25 only if the Administrator decides the security program provides passengers of the foreign air carrier a level of protection similar to the level those passengers would receive under the security programs of air carriers serving the same airport. The Administrator shall require a foreign air carrier to use procedures equivalent to those required of air carriers serving the same airport if the Administrator decides that the procedures are necessary to provide a level of protection similar to that provided passengers of the air carriers serving the same airport. The Administrator shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.
