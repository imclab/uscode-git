In determining those costs, the Secretary shall include in-kind contributions by the State. Amounts of the State and its political subdivisions required to be expended under section 31102(b)(1)(D) of this title may not be included as part of the share not provided by the United States Government. The Secretary may allocate among the States whose applications for grants have been approved those amounts appropriated for grants to support those programs, under criteria that may be established.
