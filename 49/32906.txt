  (a) T4Maximum IncreasesK.–(1)(A) For each of the model years 1993–2004 for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile), the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer attributable to dual fueled automobiles is 1.2 miles a gallon.
  (B) If the application of section 32905(b) and (d) of this title is extended under section 32905(f) of this title, for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile) the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer for each of the model years 2005–2008 attributable to dual fueled automobiles is .9 mile a gallon.
  (2) In applying paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine the increase in a manufacturer“s average fuel economy attributable to dual fueled automobiles by subtracting from the manufacturer“s average fuel economy calculated under section 32905(e) of this title the number equal to what the manufacturer“s average fuel economy would be if it were calculated by the formula in section 32904(a)(1) of this title by including as the denominator for each model of dual fueled automobile the fuel economy when the automobiles are operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. If the increase attributable to dual fueled automobiles for any model year described–
    (A) in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection is more than 1.2 miles a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(A) applies; and
    (B) in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection is more than .9 mile a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(B) applies.
  (b) T4OffsetsK.–Notwithstanding this section and sections 32901(c) and 32905 of this title, if the Secretary of Transportation reduces the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles for any model year below 27.5 miles a gallon, an increase in average fuel economy for passenger automobiles of more than .7 mile a gallon to which a manufacturer of dual fueled automobiles would otherwise be entitled is reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the reduction in the standard. However, the increase may not be reduced to less than .7 mile a gallon.
