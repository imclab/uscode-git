  (a) T4Existence and Amounts in FundK.–The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of–
    (1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)–(e) of this title; and
    (2) 25 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).
  (b) T4Availability of AmountsK.–Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter. However, 50 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f) and added to the fund is available for making grants for projects at small hub airports (as defined in section 41731 of this title).
  (c) T4Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever AirportsK.–At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants–
    (1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and
    (2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.
  (d) T4ConsiderationsK.–In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider–
    (1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;
    (2) the project benefit and cost, including, in the case of a project at a reliever airport, the number of operations projected to be diverted from a primary airport to the reliever airport as a result of the project, as well as the cost savings projected to be realized by users of the local airport system;
    (3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity;
    (4) the airport improvement priorities of the States, and regional offices of the Administration, to the extent such priorities are not in conflict with paragraphs (1) and (2);
    (5) the projected growth in the number of passengers that will be using the airport at which the project will be carried out; and
    (6) any increase in the number of passenger boardings in the preceding 12-month period at the airport at which the project will be carried out, with priority consideration to be given to projects at airports at which the number of passenger boardings increased by at least 20 percent as compared to the number of passenger boardings in the 12-month period preceding such period.
  (e) T4Waiving Percentage RequirementK.–If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.
  (f) T4Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.–
    (1) T4General ruleK.–Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.
    (2) T4Required findingK.–Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport“s fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport“s first fiscal year ending after August 23, 1994, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
  (g) T4Minimum Amount To Be Credited.–
    (1) T4General ruleK.–In a fiscal year, there shall be credited to the fund, out of amounts made available under section 48103 of this title, an amount that is at least equal to the sum of–
      (A) $148,000,000; plus
      (B) the total amount required from the fund to carry out in the fiscal year letters of intent issued before January 1, 1996, under section 47110(e) of this title or the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982.
     The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.
    (2) T4Reduction of apportionmentsK.–In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) is less than the minimum amount to be credited under paragraph (1), the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals such minimum amount.
    (3) T4Amount of reductionK.–For a fiscal year, the total amount available to make a reduction to carry out paragraph (2) is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A), 47114(c)(2), 47114(d), and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.
    (4) T4Special ruleK.–For a fiscal year in which the amount credited to the fund under this subsection exceeds $300,000,000, the Secretary shall allocate the amount of such excess as follows:
      (A) \1/3\ shall be made available to airports for which apportionments are made under section 47114(d) of this title.
      (B) \1/3\ shall be made available for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2) of this title and for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c)(1) of this title.
      (C) \1/3\ shall be made available to current or former military airports for which grants may be made under section 47117(e)(1)(B) of this title.
  (h) T4Priority for Letters of IntentK.–In making grants in a fiscal year with funds made available under this section, the Secretary shall fulfill intentions to obligate under section 47110(e).
