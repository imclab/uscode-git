  (a) T4Transportation To Be Continued if Criterion MetK.–Amtrak shall continue to provide rail passenger transportation provided under section 403(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act before October 1, 1981, if, after considering estimated fare increases and State and local contributions to the transportation, the transportation meets the short distance route criterion under section 24705(a)(1)  of this title, as adjusted. Transportation continued under this section shall be financed consistent with the method of financing in effect on September 30, 1981. If the transportation is not estimated to meet the criterion, as adjusted, Amtrak may modify or discontinue the transportation so that the criterion is met.
  (b) T4Transportation With Short-Term Avoidable LossK.–Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if after September 30, 1993, and before October 1, 1995, transportation provided under subsection (a) on a route during the prior 6 months has a short-term avoidable loss (excluding the cost of providing passenger equipment needed to provide the transportation), Amtrak may choose to consider modifying or discontinuing the transportation. If Amtrak does make such a choice, Amtrak shall solicit public comment for at least 30 days on alternatives to the modification or discontinuance. Not later than 60 days after the comment period ends, Amtrak may modify or discontinue the transportation so that there is no short-term avoidable loss under this section for providing the transportation on the route.
