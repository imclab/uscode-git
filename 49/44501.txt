      (ii) to provide the highest degree of safety in air travel.
    (B) The plan shall–
      (i) provide estimates by year of the schedule, cost, and work force levels for each active and planned major research and development project under sections 40119, 44504, 44505, 44507, 44509, 44511–44513, and 44912 of this title, including activities carried out under cooperative agreements with other Federal departments and agencies;
      (ii) specify the goals and the priorities for allocation of resources among the major categories of research and development activities, including the rationale for the priorities identified;
      (iii) identify the allocation of resources among long-term research, near-term research, and development activities;
      (iv) identify the individual research and development projects in each funding category that are described in the annual budget request;
