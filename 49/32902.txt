    (A) imports; or
    (B) brings into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under chapter 301 of this title for an individual under section 30142 of this title.
  (4) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the contents of an application for an exemption.
  (e) T4Emergency VehiclesK.–(1) In this subsection, ””emergency vehicle““ means an automobile manufactured primarily for use–
    (A) as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse;
    (B) by the United States Government or a State or local government for law enforcement; or
    (C) for other emergency uses prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.
