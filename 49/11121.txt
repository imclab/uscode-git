      (A) providing the facilities or equipment will not materially and adversely affect the ability of the rail carrier to provide safe and adequate transportation;
      (B) the amount spent for the facilities or equipment, including a return equal to the rail carrier“s current cost of capital, will be recovered; and
      (C) providing the facilities or equipment will not impair the ability of the rail carrier to attract adequate capital.
