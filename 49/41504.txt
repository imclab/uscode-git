A tariff–
    (1) shall contain–
      (A) to the extent the Secretary requires by regulation, a description of the classifications, rules, and practices related to the foreign air transportation;
      (B) a statement of the prices in money of the United States; and
      (C) other information the Secretary requires by regulation; and
