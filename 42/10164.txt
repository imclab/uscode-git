   After the MRS Commission submits its report to the Congress under section 10163 of this title, the Secretary may conduct a survey and evaluation of potentially suitable sites for a monitored retrievable storage facility. In conducting such survey and evaluation, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which siting a monitored retrievable storage facility at each site surveyed wouldâ€“
  (1) enhance the reliability and flexibility of the system for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste established under this chapter;
  (2) minimize the impacts of transportation and handling of such fuel and waste;
  (3) provide for public confidence in the ability of such system to safely dispose of the fuel and waste;
  (4) impose minimal adverse effects on the local community and the local environment;
  (5) provide a high probability that the facility will meet applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in a timely fashion;
  (6) provide such other benefits to the system for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste as the Secretary deems appropriate; and
  (7) unduly burden a State in which significant volumes of high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense activities are stored.
