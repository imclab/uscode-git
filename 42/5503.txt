      (A) interim performance criteria for solar heating components and systems to be used in residential dwellings, and
      (B) interim performance criteria (relating to suitability for solar heating) for such dwellings themselves,
         taking into account in each instance climatic variations existing between different geographic areas.
    (2) As soon as possible after the publication of the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Administrator, will select on the basis of open competition a number of designs for various types of residential dwellings suitable for and adapted to the installation of solar heating systems meeting the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1)(A).
  (c) Contracts and grants for development of heating systems for commercial production and residential use; contracts for procurement of heating systems and components

    (1) enter into such contracts and grants as may be necessary or appropriate for the development (for commercial production and residential use) of solar heating systems meeting the performance criteria prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section (including any further planning and design which may be required to conform with the specifications set forth in such criteria); and
    (2) enter into contracts with a number of persons or firms for the procurement of solar heating components and systems meeting such performance criteria (including adequate numbers of spare and replacement parts for such systems).

     The Secretary of Defense shall arrange for the installation of solar heating systems procured by the Administrator under subsection (c)(2) of this section in a substantial number of residential dwellings which are located on Federal or federally administered property where the performance and operation of such systems can be regularly and effectively observed and monitored by designated Federal personnel.
  (f) Coordination of activities to assure a realistic and effective demonstration
     The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense, and officials responsible for administering Federal or federally administered property, shall coordinate their activities under this section to assure that solar heating systems are installed in a substantial number of residential dwellings and in a sufficient number of different geographic areas under varying climatic conditions to constitute a realistic and effective demonstration in support of the objectives of this subchapter.
