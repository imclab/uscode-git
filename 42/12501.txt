  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds the following:
    (1) Throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs.
    (2) Americans desire to affirm common responsibilities and shared values, and join together in positive experiences, that transcend race, religion, gender, age, disability, region, income, and education.
    (3) The rising costs of postsecondary education are putting higher education out of reach for an increasing number of citizens.
    (4) Americans of all ages can improve their communities and become better citizens through service to the United States.
    (5) Nonprofit organizations, local governments, States, and the Federal Government are already supporting a wide variety of national service programs that deliver needed services in a cost-effective manner.
    (6) Residents of low-income communities, especially youth and young adults, can be empowered through their service, and can help provide future community leadership.

    (1) meet the unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs of the United States, without displacing existing workers;
