      (B) meet the requirements for admission as a trainee of the State or local police force to which the participant will be assigned pursuant to section 14099(5) of this title, including achievement of satisfactory scores on any applicable examination, except that failure to meet the age requirement for a trainee of the State or local police shall not disqualify the applicant if the applicant will be of sufficient age upon completing an undergraduate course of study;
      (C) possess the necessary mental and physical capabilities and emotional characteristics to discharge effectively the duties of a law enforcement officer;
      (D) be of good character and demonstrate sincere motivation and dedication to law enforcement and public service;

      (F) in the case of a participant desiring to undertake or continue graduate study, agree in writing that the participant will accept an appointment and complete 4 years of service as an officer in the State police or in a local police department within the State before undertaking or continuing graduate study;
      (G) contract, with the consent of the participant“s parent or guardian if the participant is a minor, to serve for 4 years as an officer in the State police or in a local police department, if an appointment is offered; and
      (H) except as provided in paragraph (2), be without previous law enforcement experience.

        (i) have had some law enforcement experience; and
        (ii) have demonstrated special leadership potential and dedication to law enforcement.
      (B)        (i) The prior period of law enforcement of a participant selected pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the participant“s 4-year service obligation under section 14098 of this title, and such a participant shall be subject to the same benefits and obligations under this part as other participants, including those stated in section \1\N (b)(1)(E) and (F) of this section.
        (ii) Clause (i) shall not be construed to preclude counting a participant“s previous period of law enforcement experience for purposes other than satisfaction of the requirements of section 14098 of this title, such as for purposes of determining such a participant“s pay and other benefits, rank, and tenure.
    (3) It is the intent of this part that there shall be no more than 20,000 participants in each graduating class.

In a year in which applications are received in a number greater than that which will produce, in the judgment of the Director, a graduating class of more than 20,000, the Director shall, in deciding which applications to grant, give preference to those who will be participating in State plans that provide law enforcement personnel to areas of greatest need.
