  (a) National advanced scientific and technical education program
     The Director of the National Science Foundation (hereafter in sections 1862h to 1862j of this title referred to as the ””Director““) shall award grants to associate-degree-granting colleges, and consortia thereof, to assist them in providing education in advanced-technology fields. The grant program shall place emphasis on the needs of students who have been in the workforce (including work in the home), and shall be designed to strengthen and expand the scientific and technical education and training capabilities of associate-degree-granting colleges through such methods as–
    (1) the development of model instructional programs in advanced-technology fields;
    (2) the professional development of faculty and instructors, both full- and part-time, in advanced-technology fields;
    (3) the establishment of innovative partnership arrangements that–
      (A) involve associate-degree-granting colleges and other appropriate public and private sector entities, and
      (B) provide for private sector donations, faculty opportunities to have short-term assignments with industry, sharing of program costs, equipment loans, and the cooperative use of laboratories, plants, and other facilities, and provision for state-of-the-art work experience opportunities for students enrolled in such programs;
    (4) the acquisition of state-of-the-art instrumentation essential to programs designed to prepare and upgrade students in scientific and advanced-technology fields; and
    (5) the development and dissemination of instructional materials in support of improving the advanced scientific and technical education and training capabilities of associate-degree-granting colleges, including programs for students who are not pursuing a science degree.
  (b) National centers of scientific and technical education
     The Director shall award grants for the establishment of centers of excellence, not to exceed 10 in number, among associate-degree-granting colleges. Centers shall meet one or both of the following criteria:
    (1) Exceptional instructional programs in advanced-technology fields.
    (2) Excellence in undergraduate education in mathematics and science.
       The centers shall serve as national and regional clearinghouses and models for the benefit of both colleges and secondary schools, and shall provide seminars and programs to disseminate model curricula and model teaching methods and instructional materials to other associate-degree-granting colleges in the geographic region served by the center.
  (c) Articulation partnerships
    (1) Partnership grants
      (A) The Director shall make grants to eligible partnerships to encourage students to pursue bachelor degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, or technology, and to assist students pursuing bachelor degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, or technology to make the transition from associate-degree-granting colleges to bachelor-degree-granting institutions, through such means as–
        (i) examining curricula to ensure that academic credit earned at the associate-degree-granting college is transferable to bachelor-degree-granting institutions;
        (ii) informing teachers from the associate-degree-granting college on the specific requirements of courses at the bachelor-degree-granting institution; and
        (iii) providing summer educational programs for students from the associate-degree-granting college to encourage such students“ subsequent matriculation at bachelor-degree-granting institutions.
      (B) Each eligible partnership receiving a grant under this paragraph shall, at a minimum–
        (i) counsel students, including students who have been in the workforce (including work in the home), about the requirements and course offerings of the bachelor-degree-granting institution; and
        (ii) conduct workshops and orientation sessions to ensure that students are familiar with programs, including laboratories and financial aid programs, at the bachelor-degree-granting institution.
       Funds used by eligible partnerships to carry out clauses (i) and (ii) shall be from non-Federal sources. In-cash and in-kind resources used by eligible partnerships to carry out clauses (i) and (ii) shall not be considered to be contributions for purposes of applying subsection (f)(3) of this section.
      (C) Any institution participating in a partnership that receives a grant under this paragraph shall be ineligible to receive assistance under part B of title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.] for the duration of the grant received under this paragraph.
    (2) Outreach grants
       The Director shall make grants to associate-degree-granting colleges with outstanding mathematics and science programs to strengthen relationships with secondary schools in the community served by the college by improving mathematics and science education and encouraging the interest and aptitude of secondary school students for careers in science and advanced-technology fields through such means as developing agreements with local educational agencies to enable students to satisfy entrance and course requirements at the associate-degree-granting college.
  (d) Coordination with other Federal departments
     In carrying out this section, the Director shall consult, cooperate, and coordinate, to enhance program effectiveness and to avoid duplication, with the programs and policies of other relevant Federal agencies. In carrying out subsection (c) of this section, the Director shall coordinate activities with programs receiving assistance under part B of title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.].
  (e) Limitation on funding
     To qualify for a grant under this section, an associate-degree-granting college, or consortium thereof, shall provide assurances adequate to the Director that it will not decrease its level of spending of funds from non-Federal sources on advanced scientific and technical education and training programs.
  (f) Functions of Director
     In carrying out sections 1862h to 1862j of this title, the Director shall–
    (1) award grants on a competitive, merit basis;

    (4) establish and maintain a readily accessible inventory of the programs assisted under sections 1862h to 1862j of this title; and
    (5) designate an officer of the National Science Foundation to serve as a liaison with associate-degree-granting institutions for the purpose of enhancing the role of such institutions in the activities of the Foundation.
