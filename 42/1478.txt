     The committees utilized or appointed pursuant to this section may examine applications of persons desiring to obtain the benefits of section 1471(a)(1) and (2) of this title as they relate to the successful operation of a farm, and may submit recommendations to the Secretary with respect to each applicant as to whether the applicant is eligible to receive such benefits, whether by reason of his character, ability, and experience he is likely successfully to carry out undertakings required of him under a loan under such section, and whether the farm with respect to which the application is made is of such character that there is a reasonable likelihood that the making of the loan requested will carry out the purposes of this subchapter. The committees may also certify to the Secretary with respect to the amount of any loan.
