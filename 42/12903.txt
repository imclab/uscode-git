     The Secretary shall, to the extent of amounts approved in appropriations Acts under section 12912 of this title, make grants to States, units of general local government, and nonprofit organizations.

    (1) Formula allocation
       The Secretary shall allocate 90 percent of the amounts approved in appropriation Acts under section 12912 of this title among States and cities whose most recent comprehensive housing affordability strategy (or abbreviated strategy) has been approved by the Secretary under section 12705 of this title. Such amounts shall be allocated as follows:
      (A) 75 percent among–
        (i) cities that are the most populous unit of general local government in a metropolitan statistical area having a population greater than 500,000 and more than 1,500 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; and
        (ii) States with more than 1,500 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome outside of metropolitan statistical areas described in clause (i); and
      (B) 25 percent among cities that (i) are the most populous unit of general local government in a metropolitan statistical area having a population greater than 500,000 and more than 1,500 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and (ii) have a higher than average per capita incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
       A single city may receive assistance allocated under subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B). For purposes of allocating amounts under this paragraph for any fiscal year, the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome shall be the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service as of March 31 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the amounts are appropriated and to be allocated.
    (2) Minimum grant
       Subject only to the availability of amounts pursuant to appropriations Acts under section 12912 of this title, for each fiscal year each eligible grantee under paragraph (1) shall receive funding according to its proportionate share of the total, except that each entity shall receive a minimum allocation of $200,000 from subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) combined, and any increase this entails from the formula amount will be deducted from all other allocations exceeding $200,000 on a pro rata basis. If allocation under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) would allocate less than $200,000 for any State, the allocation for such State shall be $200,000 and the amount of the increase under this sentence shall be deducted on a pro rata basis from the allocations of the other States, except that a reduction under this subparagraph may not reduce the amount allocated to any eligible entity to less than $200,000.
    (3) Nonformula allocation
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall allocate 10 percent of the amounts appropriated under section 12912 of this title among–
        (i) States and units of general local government that do not qualify for allocation of amounts under paragraph (1); and
        (ii) States, units of general local government, and nonprofit organizations, to fund special projects of national significance.
      (B) Selection
         In selecting projects under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider (i) relative numbers of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases and per capita acquired immunodeficiency syndrome incidence; (ii) housing needs of eligible persons in the community; (iii) extent of local planning and coordination of housing programs for eligible persons; and (iv) the likelihood of the continuation of State and local efforts.
      (C) National significance projects
         For the purpose of subparagraph (A)(ii), in selecting projects of national significance the Secretary shall consider (i) the need to assess the effectiveness of a particular model for providing supportive housing for eligible persons; (ii) the innovative nature of the proposed activity; and (iii) the potential replicability of the proposed activity in other similar localities or nationally.
  (d) Applications
     Funds made available under this section shall be allocated among applications submitted by applicants and approved by the Secretary.

    (6) such other information or certifications that the Secretary determines to be necessary to achieve the purposes of this section.
  (e) Additional requirement for metropolitan areas
     In addition to the other requirements of this section, to be eligible for a grant to a metropolitan area under this section, the major city, urban county, and any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that metropolitan area shall establish or designate a governmental agency or organization for receipt and use of amounts received from a grant under this section and shall submit to the Secretary, together with the application under subsection (d) of this section a proposal for the operation of such agency or organization.
  (f) Additional requirement for city formula grantees
     In addition to the other requirements of this section, to be eligible for a grant pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, a city shall provide such assurances as the Secretary may require that any grant amounts received will be allocated among eligible activities in a manner that addresses the needs within the metropolitan statistical area in which the city is located, including areas not within the jurisdiction of the city. Any such city shall coordinate with other units of general local government located within the metropolitan statistical area to provide such assurances and comply with the assurances.
