        (iv) develop, and coordinate the execution of, Federal interagency plans to respond to an earthquake, with specific plans for each high-risk area which ensure the availability of adequate emergency medical resources, search and rescue personnel and equipment, and emergency broadcast capability;
        (v) develop approaches to combine measures for earthquake hazards reduction with measures for reduction of other natural and technological hazards; and
        (vi) provide response recommendations to communities after an earthquake prediction has been made under paragraph (3)(D).
         In addition, the Director of the Agency may enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with States and local jurisdictions to establish demonstration projects on earthquake hazard mitigation, to link earthquake research and mitigation efforts with emergency management programs, or to prepare educational materials for national distribution.
      (B) State assistance program criteria
         In order to qualify for assistance under subparagraph (A)(i), a State must–
        (i) demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State;
        (ii) provide a share of the costs of the activities for which assistance is being given, in accordance with subparagraph (C); and
        (iii) meet such other requirements as the Director of the Agency shall prescribe.
      (C) Non-Federal cost sharing
        (i) In the case of any State which has received, before October 1, 1990, a grant from the Agency for activities under this chapter which included a requirement for cost sharing by matching such grant, any grant obtained from the Agency for activities under subparagraph (A)(i) after such date shall not include a requirement for cost sharing in an amount greater than 50 percent of the cost of the project for which the grant is made.
        (ii) In the case of any State which has not received, before October 1, 1990, a grant from the Agency for activities under this chapter which included a requirement for cost sharing by matching such grant, any grant obtained from the Agency for activities under subparagraph (A)(i) after such date–
          (I) shall not include a requirement for cost sharing for the first fiscal year of such a grant;
          (II) shall not include a requirement for cost sharing in an amount greater than 25 percent of the cost of the project for which the grant is made for the second fiscal year of such grant, and any cost sharing requirement may be satisfied through in-kind contributions;
          (III) shall not include a requirement for cost sharing in an amount greater than 35 percent of the cost of the project for which the grant is made for the third fiscal year of such grant, and any cost sharing requirement may be satisfied through in-kind contributions; and
          (IV) shall not include a requirement for cost sharing in an amount greater than 50 percent of the cost of the project for which the grant is made for the fourth and subsequent fiscal years of such grant.
    (3) United States Geological Survey
       The United States Geological Survey shall conduct research necessary to characterize and identify earthquake hazards, assess earthquake risks, monitor seismic activity, and improve earthquake predictions. In carrying out this paragraph, the Director of the United States Geological Survey shall–
      (A) conduct a systematic assessment of the seismic risks in each region of the Nation prone to earthquakes, including, where appropriate, the establishment and operation of intensive monitoring projects on hazardous faults, seismic microzonation studies in urban and other developed areas where earthquake risk is determined to be significant, and engineering seismology studies;
      (B) work with officials of State and local governments to ensure that they are knowledgeable about the specific seismic risks in their areas;
      (C) develop standard procedures, in consultation with the Agency, for issuing earthquake predictions, including aftershock advisories;
      (D) issue when necessary, and notify the Director of the Agency of, an earthquake prediction or other earthquake advisory, which may be evaluated by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, which shall be exempt from the requirements of section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act when meeting for such purposes;
      (E) establish, using existing facilities, a Center for the International Exchange of Earthquake Information which shall–
        (i) promote the exchange of information on earthquake research and earthquake preparedness between the United States and other nations;
        (ii) maintain a library containing selected reports, research papers, and data produced through the Program;

      (A) encourage prompt dissemination of significant findings, sharing of data, samples, physical collections, and other supporting materials, and development of intellectual property so research results can be used by appropriate organizations to mitigate earthquake damage;
      (B) in addition to supporting individual investigators, support university research consortia and centers for research in geosciences and in earthquake engineering;
      (C) work closely with the United States Geological Survey to identify geographic regions of national concern that should be the focus of targeted solicitations for earthquake-related research proposals;
      (D) emphasize, in earthquake engineering research, development of economically feasible methods to retrofit existing buildings and to protect lifelines to mitigate earthquake damage; and
      (E) support research that studies the political, economic, and social factors that influence the implementation of hazard reduction measures.
    (5) National Institute of Standards and Technology
       The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall be responsible for carrying out research and development to improve building codes and standards and practices for structures and lifelines. In carrying out this paragraph, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall–
