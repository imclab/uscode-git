  (a) Prescription by Secretary; requirements
    (1) The Secretary may conduct an evaluation of a class of covered equipment and may prescribe test procedures for such class in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (2) Test procedures prescribed in accordance with this section shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which reflect energy efficiency, energy use, and estimated operating costs of a type of industrial equipment (or class thereof) during a representative average use cycle (as determined by the Secretary), and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct.
    (3) If the test procedure is a procedure for determining estimated annual operating costs, such procedure shall provide that such costs shall be calculated from measurements of energy use in a representative average-use cycle (as determined by the Secretary), and from representative average unit costs of the energy needed to operate such equipment during such cycle. The Secretary shall provide information to manufacturers of covered equipment respecting representative average unit costs of energy.
    (4)      (A) With respect to small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks to which standards are applicable under section 6313 of this title, the test procedures shall be those generally accepted industry testing procedures or rating procedures developed or recognized by the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, as referenced in ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 and in effect on June 30, 1992.
      (B) If such an industry test procedure or rating procedure for small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, or unfired hot water storage tanks is amended, the Secretary shall amend the test procedure for the product as necessary to be consistent with the amended industry test procedure or rating procedure unless the Secretary determines, by rule, published in the Federal Register and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that to do so would not meet the requirements for test procedures described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.
      (C) If the Secretary prescribes a rule containing such a determination, the rule may establish an amended test procedure for such product that meets the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. In establishing any amended test procedure under this subparagraph or subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall follow the procedures and meet the requirements specified in section 6293(e) of this title.
    (5)      (A) With respect to electric motors to which standards are applicable under section 6313 of this title, the test procedures shall be the test procedures specified in NEMA Standards Publication MG1–1987 and IEEE Standard 112 Test Method B for motor efficiency, as in effect on October 24, 1992.
      (B) If the test procedure requirements of NEMA Standards Publication MG–1987 and IEEE Standard 112 Test Method B for motor efficiency are amended, the Secretary shall amend the test procedures established by subparagraph (A) to conform to such amended test procedure requirements unless the Secretary determines, by rule, published in the Federal Register and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that to do so would not meet the requirements for test procedures described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.
      (C) If the Secretary prescribes a rule containing such a determination, the rule may establish amended test procedures for such electric motors that meets the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. In establishing any amended test procedure under this subparagraph or subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall follow the procedures and meet the requirements specified in section 6293(e) of this title.
  (b) Publication in Federal Register; presentment of oral and written data, views, and arguments by interested persons
     Before prescribing any final test procedures under this section, the Secretary shall–
    (1) publish proposed test procedures in the Federal Register; and
    (2) afford interested persons an opportunity (of not less than 45 days“ duration) to present oral and written data, views, and arguments on the proposed test procedures.
  (c) Reevaluations
    (1) The Secretary shall, not later than 3 years after the date of prescribing a test procedure under this section (and from time to time thereafter), conduct a reevaluation of such procedure and, on the basis of such reevaluation, shall determine if such test procedure should be amended. In conducting such reevaluation, the Secretary shall take into account such information as he deems relevant, including technological developments relating to the energy efficiency of the type (or class) of covered equipment involved.
    (2) If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that a test procedure should be amended, he shall promptly publish in the Federal Register proposed test procedures incorporating such amendments and afford interested persons an opportunity to present oral and written data, views, and arguments. Such comment period shall not be less than 45 days“ duration.
  (d) Prohibited representations
    (1) Effective 180 days (or, in the case of small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks, 360 days) after a test procedure rule applicable to any covered equipment is prescribed under this section, no manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation–
      (A) in writing (including any representation on a label), or
      (B) in any broadcast advertisement,
         respecting the energy consumption of such equipment or cost of energy consumed by such equipment, unless such equipment has been tested in accordance with such test procedure and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.
    (2) On the petition of any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler, filed not later than the 60th day before the expiration of the period involved, the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (1) may be extended by the Secretary with respect to the petitioner (but in no event for more than an additional 180 days) if he finds that the requirements of paragraph (1) would impose on such petitioner an undue hardship (as determined by the Secretary).
  (e) Assistance by National Institute of Standards and Technology
     The Secretary may direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide such assistance as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out his responsibilities under this part, including the development of test procedures.
