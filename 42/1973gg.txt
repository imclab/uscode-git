    (2) it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right; and
    (3) discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities.
  (b) Purposes
     The purposes of this subchapter are–
    (1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office;
    (2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this subchapter in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office;
    (3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and
    (4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.
