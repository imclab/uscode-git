   The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application with respect to the use of solid waste combined with coal as a fuel source for clean coal combustion technologies. The program shall addressâ€“
  (1) the feasibility of cofiring coal and used vehicle tires in fluidized bed combustion units;
  (2) the combined gasification of coal and municipal sludge using integrated gasification combined cycle technology;
  (3) the creation of fuel pellets combining coal and material reclaimed from solid waste;
  (4) the feasibility of cofiring, in fluidized bed combustion units, waste methane from coal mines, including ventilation air, together with coal or coal wastes; and
  (5) other sources of waste and coal mixtures in other applications that the Secretary considers appropriate.
