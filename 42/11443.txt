  (b) Special consideration
    (1) In general
       In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary of Labor may give special consideration to applicants that will implement projects that will serve areas of greatest need, including urban and rural areas, as demonstrated by–
      (A) the large number or concentration of homeless individuals in the project area relative to other similar areas of jurisdiction;
      (B) the high rates of poverty in the project area as determined by the census; or
      (C) the lack of available low cost or affordable housing within the project area, as measured by such indicators as high average local rents or vacancy rates.
    (2) Holistic service approach
       In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary of Labor may give special consideration to applicants that will implement programs that include formal reciprocal referral agreements with other programs such as substance abuse counseling, local shelters, and subsidized housing that provide a holistic service approach on an individual case management basis.
