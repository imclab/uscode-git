Amounts remaining after allotment under the preceding sentence shall be reallotted in accordance with clause (B) of such sentence among schools whose applications requested more than the amounts so allotted to their loan funds, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the total allotted to any such schoolâ€œs loan fund from exceeding the total so requested by it.
  (c) Allotment of excess funds
     Funds available in any fiscal year for payment to schools under this subpart which are in excess of the amount appropriated pursuant to this section for that year shall be allotted among schools in such manner as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purposes of this subpart.

    (2) Date certain for contributions
       Amounts described in paragraph (1) that are returned to the Secretary before the fourth quarter of a fiscal year shall be obligated before the end of such fiscal year, and may not be obligated before the fourth quarter.

    (3) Preference in making contributions
       In making Federal capital contributions to student loans funds under section 292q of this title for a fiscal year from amounts described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to health professions schools of the same disciplines as the health professions schools returning such amounts for the period during which the amounts expended for such contributions were received by the Secretary.
