     Whenever a licensee fails to comply with any applicable provision of this chapter or any applicable rule, regulation, restriction, or condition issued or imposed by the Administrator under the authority of this chapter, the Attorney General, at the request of the Administrator, shall file an action in the appropriate United States district court toâ€“

    (2) if such failure is knowing and continues for a period of 30 days after the Administrator mails notification of such failure by registered letter to the licensee at his record post office address, revoke such license.
       No proceeding under this section is necessary if the license, by its terms, provides for automatic suspension or termination upon the occurrence of a fixed or agreed upon condition, event, or time.
