  (a) Program direction
     The Secretary shall conduct a 5-year program on renewable hydrogen energy systems. Such program shall be conducted in accordance with the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–566) [42 U.S.C. 124–1 et seq.], to supplement ongoing activities of a similar nature at the Department of Energy, including–
    (1) at least one program to generate hydrogen from renewable energy sources;
    (2) at least one program to assess the feasibility of existing natural gas pipelines carrying hydrogen gas, including experimentation if needed, with a goal of determining those components of the natural gas distribution system that would have to be modified to carry–
      (A) more than 20 percent hydrogen mixed with natural gas; and
      (B) pure hydrogen gas;
    (3) at least one program to develop a hydrogen storage system suitable for electric motor vehicles powered by fuel cells, with emphasis on–
      (A) improved metal hydride hydrogen storage;
      (B) activated carbon-based hydrogen storage;
      (C) high pressure compressed hydrogen; or
      (D) other novel hydrogen storage techniques;
    (4) at least one program to develop a fuel cell suitable to power an electric motor vehicle; and
    (5) such other programs as the Secretary considers necessary to carry out this section.
  (b) Proposals
     Within 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall solicit proposals for conducting activities under this section.
