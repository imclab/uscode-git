   The Congress finds that–
  (1) the Federal Government is the largest single energy consumer in the Nation;
  (2) the cost of meeting the Federal Government“s energy requirement is substantial;
  (3) there are significant opportunities in the Federal Government to conserve and make more efficient use of energy through improved operations and maintenance, the use of new energy efficient technologies, and the application and achievement of energy efficient design and construction;
  (4) Federal energy conservation measures can be financed at little or no cost to the Federal Government by using private investment capital made available through contracts authorized by subchapter VII of this chapter; and
  (5) an increase in energy efficiency by the Federal Government would benefit the Nation by reducing the cost of government, reducing national dependence on foreign energy resources, and demonstrating the benefits of greater energy efficiency to the Nation.
