  (b) Considerations in making grants
    (1) Requirement of status as grantee under part B of subchapter XVII
       The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section to a public entity only if–

      (C) in the case of a public entity that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the State in which the tribe or tribal organization is located is such a grantee.
    (2) Requirement of status as medicaid provider
      (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section only if, in the case of any service under such subsection that is covered in the State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] for the State involved–
        (i) the public entity involved will provide the service directly, and the entity has entered into a participation agreement under the State plan and is qualified to receive payments under such plan; or

        (ii) A determination by the Secretary of whether an organization referred to in clause (i) meets the criteria for a waiver under such clause shall be made without regard to whether the organization accepts voluntary donations regarding the provision of services to the public.

       In making grants under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall–
      (A) equitably allocate such assistance among the principal geographic regions of the United States;
      (B) consider the extent to which the public entity involved has a need for the grant; and
      (C) in the case of any public entity that is a political subdivision of a State or that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization–
        (i) shall consider any comments regarding the application of the entity for such a grant that are received by the Secretary from the State in which the entity is located; and
        (ii) shall give special consideration to the entity if the State agrees to provide a portion of the non-Federal contributions required in subsection (c) of this section regarding such a grant.
  (c) Matching funds
    (1) In general
       A funding agreement for a grant under subsection (a) of this section is that the public entity involved will, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the entity in carrying out the purpose described in such subsection, make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that–
      (A) for the first fiscal year for which the entity receives payments from a grant under such subsection, is not less than $1 for each $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant;
