  (a) Funds for recovery investment plans
     The President is authorized to provide funds to any Recovery Planning Council for the implementation of a recovery investment plan by public bodies. Such funds may be usedâ€“
    (1) to make loans for the acquisition or development of land and improvements for public works, public service, or development facility usage, including the acquisition or development of parks or open spaces, and the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, alteration, expansion, or improvement of such facilities, including related machinery and equipment, and
    (2) to make supplementary grants to increase the Federal share for projects for which funds are reserved pursuant to section 3232(c)(2) of this title, or other Federal-aid projects in the affected area.
  (b) Eligible entities for grants and loans
     Grants and loans under this section may be made to any State, local government, or private or public nonprofit organization representing any area or part thereof affected by a major disaster.
  (c) Federal share, increase by supplementary grants; limits
     No supplementary grant shall increase the Federal share of the cost of any project to greater than 90 per centum, except in the case of a grant for the benefit of Indians or Alaska Natives, or in the case of any State or local government which the President determines has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity.
  (d) Interest rate
     Loans under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, less 1 per centum per annum.
  (e) Assistance resulting in relocation of establishments or divestiture of contractors prohibited
     Financial assistance under this subchapter shall not be extended to assist establishments relocating from one area to another or to assist subcontractors whose purpose is to divest, or whose economic success is dependent upon divesting, other contractors or subcontractors of contracts therefore customarily performed by them. Such limitations shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the Secretary of Commerce finds that the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment of the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations, unless the Secretary has reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations.
