  (a) Payments to recipients; limitation, reduction, or termination
     Whenever, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics finds that a recipient of assistance under this chapter has failed to comply substantially with–
    (1) any provisions of this chapter;
    (2) any regulations or guidelines promulgated under this chapter; or
    (3) any application submitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or the provisions of any other applicable Federal Act;
       the Director involved shall, until satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply, terminate payments to the recipient under this chapter, reduce payments to the recipient under this chapter by an amount equal to the amount of such payments which were not expended in accordance with this chapter, or limit the availability of payments under this chapter to programs, projects, or activities not affected by such failure to comply.
  (b) Notice of action; reasons for action; hearing or investigation; finality of findings and determinations; reasons in detail for action without hearing
     If any grant application submitted under part A of subchapter V of this chapter or under subchapter XII–A, XII–B, XII–C, or XII–I of this chapter has been denied, or any grant under this chapter has been terminated, then the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as appropriate, shall notify the applicant of its action and set forth the reason for the action taken. Whenever such an applicant requests a hearing, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or any authorized officer thereof, is authorized and directed to hold such hearings or investigations, including hearings on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, at such times and places as necessary, following appropriate and adequate notice to such applicant; and the findings of fact and determinations made with respect thereto shall be final and conclusive, except as otherwise provided herein. The Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics is authorized to take final action without a hearing if, after an administrative review of the denial of such application or termination of such grant, it is determined that the basis for the appeal, if substantiated, would not establish a basis for awarding or continuing of the grant involved. Under such circumstances, a more detailed statement of reasons for the agency action should be made available, upon request, to the applicant.
  (c) Rehearing; regulations and procedures; presentation of additional information
     If the applicant involved is dissatisfied with the findings and determinations of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics following notice and hearing provided for in subsection (a) of this section, a request may be made for rehearing, under such regulations and procedure as the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics may establish, and such applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to present such additional information as may be deemed appropriate and pertinent to the matter involved.
