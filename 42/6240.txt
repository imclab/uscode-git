    (2) After the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reaches a level of 500,000,000 barrels, the President shall immediately seek to undertake, and thereafter continue, petroleum products acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at a level sufficient to assure that the petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least 300,000 barrels per day until the quantity of petroleum products stored within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), beginning in fiscal year 1987 and continuing through fiscal year 1994 until the quantity of crude oil in storage within the Reserve is 1,000,000,000 barrels, the President shall carry out petroleum acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at the highest practicable fill rate achievable, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
  (d) Crude oil from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1; reduction in fill-rate requirements
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no portion of the United States share of crude oil in Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk Hills) may be sold or otherwise disposed of other than to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (either directly or by exchange) during any fiscal year, except as provided in paragraph (2), unless–
      (A) the quantity of crude oil in storage within Government owned facilities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels; or
      (B) acquisition, transportation, and injection activities for the Reserve are being undertaken for that fiscal year at a level sufficient to assure that crude oil in storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average rate of at least 75,000 barrels per day for that fiscal year and the Secretary has amended the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan as required by section 6239(j) of this title.
    (2) The requirements of paragraph (1) shall not apply to the United States share of crude oil in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 which is–
      (A) sold to small refiners under section 7430(d) of title 10;
      (B) produced, consistent with sound engineering practices, for the purpose of preventing a reduction in the total quantity of crude oil available for ultimate recovery from the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1, and the amount produced is the minimum necessary to prevent such reduction; or
      (C) produced for national defense purposes under section 7422(b)(2) of title 10, pursuant to an authorization of Congress under that section during the preceding 9-month period.
    (3) In determining the number of barrels of crude oil for purposes of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), any crude oil drawndown from the Reserve as a result of any drawdown and distribution carried out under section 6241(g) of this title and not replaced under section 6241(g)(6)(B) of this title shall be considered to be within the Reserve.
    (4) For any fiscal year in which purchases of petroleum products are suspended, or the sale of petroleum products is carried out, under subsection (f) of this section, the fill-rate requirements of paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by–
      (A) the amount of petroleum products are \1\N acquired for such fiscal year as a result of such suspension; plus
      (B) the amount of petroleum products sold under such subsection during such fiscal year.
  (e) Suspensions of fill operations, etc., during emergency situations; applicability, etc.
    (1) The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply (A) if there is in effect an order of the President directing drawdown and distribution pursuant to section 6241 of this title or (B) if–
      (i) the President has found in his discretion that compliance with such provisions significantly impairs the ability of the United States to respond to a severe energy supply interruption or to meet the obligations of the United States under the international energy program; and
      (ii) the President has transmitted such finding to the Congress.

      (B) may include other mechanisms including, but not limited to, industrial petroleum reserves pursuant to section 6236 of this title and State set-aside programs, except that such mechanisms must provide equivalent control over the drawdown and distribution of such refined petroleum products as is provided under this part.
    (3) Any refined petroleum products stored in the Reserve under this subsection shall be stored in locations to be determined by the Secretary, taking into account the proximity of existing distribution systems, the proximity of the area or areas of the United States most dependent on imported petroleum products or likely to experience shortages of refined petroleum products, and the capability for expeditious distribution to such area or areas.
    (4) In the conduct of the test program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall increase the quantity of refined petroleum products acquired for storage in the Reserve by an amount equal to 10 percent of the fill of the Reserve during each of the fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994, except that the Secretary may not expend more than 10 percent of the funds appropriated for the acquisition, transportation and injection of petroleum products into the Reserve during each of the fiscal years covered by the test program.
    (5) In the conduct of the test program under paragraph (1), the Secretary may not construct or purchase facilities for the storage of refined petroleum products.
    (6) Refined petroleum products stored in the Reserve under the test program may be withdrawn from the Reserve before the conclusion of the test program–
      (A) as may be necessary to turn such products over because of changes in the physical characteristics of the product; or
      (B) on the basis of a finding made under section 6241 of this title.
  (h) Purchase from stripper well properties
    (1) If the President finds that declines in the production of oil from domestic resources pose a threat to national energy security, the President may direct the Secretary to acquire oil from domestic production of stripper well properties for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may set such terms and conditions as he deems necessary for such acquisition.
    (2) Crude oil purchased by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall be by competitive bid. The price paid by the Secretary–
      (A) shall take into account the cost of production including costs of reservoir and well maintenance; and
      (B) shall not exceed the price that would have been paid if the Secretary had acquired petroleum products of a similar quality on the open market under competitive bid procedures without regard to the source of the petroleum products.
