        (i) the first loan to the student from such fund is made before July 1, 1993; or
        (ii) the loan is made from–
          (I) a Federal capital contribution under section 292q of this title that is made from amounts appropriated under section 292t(f) of this title (in this section referred to as an ””exempt Federal capital contribution““); or
