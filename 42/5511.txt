    (2) In addition, in the case of a federally assisted mortgage loan, the cost excess specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be fully taken into account in determining the value or cost of the structure involved for purposes of applying any statutory provision specifying the maximum loan-to-value or -cost ratio; except that, if the law specifies different rates of downpayment for successive increments of such value or cost, the lowest such rate shall apply to the additional cost attributable to the solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment, and such equipment shall otherwise be excluded in determining the total value or cost of the structure.
