   The Secretary shall pursue a program of research and development with respect to the technologies needed to expand the use of low-rank coals which take into account the unique properties of lignites and sub-bituminous coals, including, but not limited to, the following areasâ€“
  (1) high value-added carbon products;
  (2) fuel cell applications;
  (3) emissions control and combustion efficiencies;
  (4) coal water fuels and underground coal gasification;
  (5) distillates; and
  (6) any other technologies which will assist in the development of niche markets for lignites and sub-bituminous coals.
