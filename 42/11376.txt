  (a) Regulations
     Not later than 60 days after July 22, 1987, the Secretary shall by notice establish such requirements as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this part. Such requirements shall be subject to section 553 of title 5. The Secretary shall issue requirements based on the initial notice before the expiration of the 12-month period following July 22, 1987. Prior to the issuance of such requirements in final form, the requirements established by the Secretary implementing the provisions of the emergency shelter grants program under the provisions made effective by section 101(g) of Public Law 99–500 or Public Law 99–591 shall govern the emergency shelter grants program under this part.
  (b) Initial allocation of assistance
     Not later than the expiration of the 60-day period following the date of enactment of a law providing appropriations to carry out this part, the Secretary shall notify each State, metropolitan city, and urban county that is to receive a direct grant of its allocation of assistance under this part. Such assistance shall be allocated and may be used notwithstanding any failure of the Secretary to issue requirements under subsection (a) of this section.
  (c) Minimum standards of habitability
     The Secretary shall prescribe such minimum standards of habitability as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that emergency shelters assisted under this section are environments that provide appropriate privacy, safety, and sanitary and other health-related conditions for homeless persons and families. Grantees are authorized to establish standards of habitability in addition to those prescribed by the Secretary.
