   In any localities where the President determines that there is an acute shortage of housing which impedes the national defense program and that the necessary housing would not otherwise be provided when needed for persons engaged in national defense activities, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may undertake the development and administration of projects to assure the availability of dwellings in such localities for such persons and their families, or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may extend financial assistance of public housing agencies for the development and administration of such projects. Such financial assistance to public housing agencies shall be extended (except as otherwise provided herein and not inconsistent herewith) under the provisions of, and in the same manner and forms as provided in, title I \1\N of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], with respect to other housing projects.
