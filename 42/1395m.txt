      (B) using such scale and appropriate conversion factors and subject to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section, fee schedules (on a regional, statewide, locality, or carrier service area basis) for payment for radiologist services under this part, to be implemented for such services furnished during 1989.
    (2) Consultation
       In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall regularly consult closely with the Physician Payment Review Commission, the American College of Radiology, and other organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiologist services and shall share with them the data and data analysis being used to make the determinations under paragraph (1), including data on variations in current medicare payments by geographic area, and by service and physician specialty.
    (3) Considerations
       In developing the relative value scale and fee schedules under paragraph (1), the Secretary–
      (A) shall take into consideration variations in the cost of furnishing such services among geographic areas and among different sites where services are furnished, and
      (B) may also take into consideration such other factors respecting the manner in which physicians in different specialties furnish such services as may be appropriate to assure that payment amounts are equitable and designed to promote effective and efficient provision of radiologist services by physicians in the different specialties.
    (4) Savings
      (A) Budget neutral fee schedules
         The Secretary shall develop preliminary fee schedules for 1989, which are designed to result in the same amount of aggregate payments (net of any coinsurance and deductibles under sections 1395T3lK(a)(1)(J) and 1395T3lK(b) of this title) for radiologist services furnished in 1989 as would have been made if this subsection had not been enacted.
      (B) Initial savings
         The fee schedules established for payment purposes under this subsection for services furnished in 1989 shall be 97 percent of the amounts permitted under the preliminary fee schedules developed under subparagraph (A).

        (iv) Adjusted conversion factor
           The adjusted conversion factor for the professional or technical component of a service in a locality is the sum of \1/2\ of the locally-adjusted amount determined under clause (v) and \1/2\ of the GPCI-adjusted amount determined under clauses \3\N (vi).
        (v) Locally-adjusted amount
           For purposes of clause (iv), the locally adjusted amount determined under this clause is the product of (I) the national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii), and (II) the index value established under clause (iii) for the locality.
        (vi) GPCI-adjusted amount
           For purposes of clause (iv), the GPCI-adjusted amount determined under this clause is the sum of–
          (I) the product of (a) the portion of the reduced national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii) which is attributable to physician work and (b) the geographic work index value for the locality (specified in Addendum C to the Model Fee Schedule for Physician Services (published on September 4, 1990, 55 Federal Register pp. 36238–36243)); and
          (II) the product of (a) the remaining portion of the reduced national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii), and (b) the geographic practice cost index value specified in section 1395u(b)(14)(C)(iv) of this title for the locality.
              In applying this clause with respect to the professional component of a service, 80 percent of the conversion factor shall be considered to be attributable to physician work and with respect to the technical component of the service, 0 percent shall be considered to be attributable to physician work.
        (vii) Limits on conversion factor
           The conversion factor to be applied to a locality to the professional or technical component of a service shall not be reduced under this subparagraph by more than 9.5 percent below the conversion factor applied in the locality under subparagraph (C) to such component, but in no case shall the conversion factor be less than 60 percent of the national weighted average of the conversion factors (computed under clause (i)).
      (E) Rule for certain scanning services
         In the case of the technical components of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services and computer assisted tomography (CAT) services furnished after December 31, 1990, the amount otherwise payable shall be reduced by 10 percent.
      (F) Subsequent updating
         For radiologist services furnished in subsequent years, the fee schedules shall be the schedules for the previous year updated by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title) for the year.
      (G) Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers
         Each fee schedule so established shall provide that the payment rate recognized for nonparticipating physicians and suppliers is equal to the appropriate percent (as defined in section 1395u(b)(4)(A)(iv) of this title) of the payment rate recognized for participating physicians and suppliers.
