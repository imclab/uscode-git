     There are hereby authorized to be appropriated $35,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $75,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, $18,750,000 for the period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, and $75,000,000 per fiscal year for the fiscal years ending September 30, 1977, September 30, 1978, September 30, 1979, September 30, 1980, and September 30, 1981, for apportionment by the Secretary among the States for the purpose of supplementing or making grants and loans authorized under subchapters I, II, III (other than planning grants authorized under sections 3151(b) and 3151a of this title), IV, and IX of this chapter. Such funds shall be apportioned among the States in the ratio which all grants made under subchapter I of this chapter since August 26, 1965, in each State bear to the total of all such grants made in all the States since August 26, 1965.
  (b) Contributions by State
     Funds apportioned to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be available for supplementing or making such grants or loans if the State makes a contribution of at least 25 per centum of the amount of such grant or loan in each case. Funds apportioned to a State under subsection (a) of this section shall remain available to such State until obligated or expended by it.
  (c) Use of funds
     Funds apportioned to a State pursuant to this section may be used by the Governor in supplementing grants or loans with respect to any project or assistance authorized under subchapters I, II, III (other than planning grants authorized under sections 3151(b) and 3151a of this title), IV, and IX of this chapter and approved by the Secretary after July 1, 1974. Such grants may be used to reduce or waive the non-Federal share otherwise required by this chapter, subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.
  (d) Federal contribution
     In the case of any grant or loan for which all or any portion of the basic Federal contribution to the project under this chapter is proposed to be made with funds available under this section, no such Federal contribution shall be made until the Secretary of Commerce certifies that such project meets all of the requirements of this chapter and could be approved for Federal contributions under this chapter if funds were available under this chapter (other than section 3188a \1\N of this title) for such project. Funds may be provided for projects in a State under this section only if the Secretary determines that the level of Federal and State financial assistance under this chapter (other than section 3188a of this title) and under Acts other than this chapter, for the same type of projects in the State, will not be diminished in order to substitute funds authorized by this section.
  (e) Applicability of State planning process to use of funds
     After June 30, 1975, funds apportioned to a State pursuant to this section shall be used by the Governor in a manner which is consistent with the State planning process assisted under section 3151a of this title, if such planning process has been established in such State.
