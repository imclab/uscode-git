An order denying such access should include the reasons for such denial.

    (B) Nothing in this section should–
      (i) obligate an individual mental health or health professional to administer treatment contrary to such professional“s clinical judgment;
      (ii) prevent any program or facility from discharging any person for whom the provision of appropriate treatment, consistent with the clinical judgment of the mental health professional primarily responsible for such person“s treatment, is or has become impossible as a result of such person“s refusal to consent to such treatment;

      (iv) obligate a program or facility to provide treatment services to any person who is admitted to such program or facility solely for diagnostic or evaluative purposes.
