   The contract with a recipient for assistance under this subpart shall be for a term of 5 years. Each contract shall provide that the recipient shall receive aggregate amounts not to exceed the appropriate existing housing fair market rent limitation under section 1437f(c) of this title in effect at the time the application is approved. At the option of the recipient and subject to the availability of such amounts, the recipient may receive in any year (1) up to 25 percent of such amounts or (2) such higher percentage as the Secretary may approve upon a demonstration satisfactory to the Secretary that the recipient has entered into firm financial commitments to ensure that the housing assistance described in the application will be provided for the full term of the contract. Any amounts not needed for a year may be used to increase the amount available in subsequent years.
