   It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide special economic development and adjustment assistance programs to help State and local areas meet special needs arising from actual or threatened severe unemployment arising from economic dislocation, including unemployment arising from actions of the Federal Government and from compliance with environmental requirements which remove economic activities from a locality, and economic adjustment problems resulting from severe changes in economic conditions (including long-term economic deterioration), and to encourage cooperative intergovernmental action to prevent or solve economic adjustment problems. Nothing in this subchapter is intended to replace the efforts of the economic adjustment program of the Department of Defense.
