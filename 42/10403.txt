    (1) each State shall be allotted not less than 1 percent of the amounts available for grants under section 10402(a) of this title for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, or $400,000, whichever is the lessor \1\N amount; and
    (2) Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall each be allotted not less than one-eighth of 1 percent of the amounts available for grants under section 10402(a) of this title for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made.
       For the purpose of the exception contained in clause (1) of the preceding sentence only, the term ””State““ does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
  (b) Determination of population of States
     For the purpose of this section, the population of each State, and the total population of all the States, shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent census data available to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall use for such purpose, if available, the annual interim current census data produced by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 181 of title 13.
  (c) Ratable reduction of amounts; increase on availability of additional funds
     If the sums appropriated under section 10409 of this title for any fiscal year for grants to States authorized under section 10402(a) of this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all States are entitled to receive under such section for such fiscal year, then the maximum amounts which all States are entitled to receive under such section for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced. In the event that additional funds become available for making such grants for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence is applicable, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.

    (2) Funds made available by the Secretary through reallotment under paragraph (1) shall remain available for expenditure until the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such funds become available for reallotment.
