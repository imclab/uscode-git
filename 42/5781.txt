  (2) Federal, State, and local governments spend close to $2,000,000,000 a year confining many of those youth;

  (4) half or more of all States are unable to spend any juvenile justice formula grant funds on delinquency prevention because of other priorities;

  (6) Federal incentives are needed to assist States and local communities in mobilizing delinquency prevention policies and programs.
