     Commercial payloads may not be accepted for launch as primary payloads on the space shuttle unless the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration determines that–

    (2) launching of the payload on the space shuttle is important for either national security or foreign policy purposes.
  (b) Report
     By March 15, 1991, the Administrator, in consultation with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report outlining the minimal requirements for documentation and other administrative data needed to procure launch services in a commercially reasonable manner, including–
    (1) the need for data to integrate a payload with a launch vehicle;
    (2) the need for data to carry out mission-specific modifications to the launch vehicle;
    (3) the need for notification to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of changes, delays, or difficulties in the construction or preparation of a launch vehicle that may affect the delivery of its payload to its destination at the time and under the conditions provided for under the contract between the United States and its contractors;
    (4) the need for data to protect public health and safety; and
    (5) the need for cost or pricing data for the fulfillment of a contract.
