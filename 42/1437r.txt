  (a) Purpose
     The purpose of this section is to encourage increased resident management of public housing projects, as a means of improving existing living conditions in public housing projects, by providing increased flexibility for public housing projects that are managed by residents by–
    (1) permitting the retention, and use for certain purposes, of any revenues exceeding operating and project costs; and
    (2) providing funding, from amounts otherwise available, for technical assistance to promote formation and development of resident management entities.
       For purposes of this section, the term ””public housing project““ includes one or more contiguous buildings or an area of contiguous row houses the elected resident councils of which approve the establishment of a resident management corporation and otherwise meet the requirements of this section.
  (b) Program requirements
    (1) Resident council
       As a condition of entering into a resident management program, the elected resident council of a public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident management corporation. When such approval is made by the elected resident council of a building or row house area, the resident management program shall not interfere with the rights of other families residing in the project or harm the efficient operation of the project. The resident management corporation and the resident council may be the same organization, if the organization complies with the requirements applicable to both the corporation and council. The corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State in which the project is located, and the tenants of the project shall be the sole voting members of the corporation. If there is no elected resident council, a majority of the households of the public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident council to determine the feasibility of establishing a resident management corporation to manage the project.
    (2) Public housing management specialist
       The resident council of a public housing project, in cooperation with the public housing agency, shall select a qualified public housing management specialist to assist in determining the feasibility of, and to help establish, a resident management corporation and to provide training and other duties agreed to in the daily operations of the project.
    (3) Bonding and insurance
       Before assuming any management responsibility for a public housing project, the resident management corporation shall provide fidelity bonding and insurance, or equivalent protection, in accordance with regulations and requirements of the Secretary and the public housing agency. Such bonding and insurance, or its equivalent, shall be adequate to protect the Secretary and the public housing agency against loss, theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the resident management corporation or its employees.
    (4) Management responsibilities
       A resident management corporation that qualifies under this section, and that supplies insurance and bonding or equivalent protection sufficient to the Secretary and the public housing agency, shall enter into a contract with the public housing agency establishing the respective management rights and responsibilities of the corporation and the public housing agency. Such contract shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter applicable to public housing projects and may include specific terms governing management personnel and compensation, access to public housing project records, submission of and adherence to budgets, rent collection procedures, tenant income verification, tenant eligibility determinations, tenant eviction, the acquisition of supplies and materials, and such other matters as may be appropriate. The contract shall be treated as a contracting out of services and shall be subject to any provision of a collective bargaining agreement regarding contracting out to which the public housing agency is subject.
    (5) Annual audit
       The books and records of a resident management corporation operating a public housing project shall be audited annually by a certified public accountant. A written report of each audit shall be forwarded to the public housing agency and the Secretary.
  (c) Comprehensive improvement assistance
     Public housing projects managed by resident management corporations may be provided with comprehensive improvement assistance under section 1437T3lK of this title for purposes of renovating such projects in accordance with such section. If such renovation activities (including the planning and architectural design of the rehabilitation) are administered by a resident management corporation, the public housing agency involved may not retain, for any administrative or other reason, any portion of the assistance provided pursuant to this subsection unless otherwise provided by contract.
  (d) Waiver of Federal requirements
    (1) Waiver of regulatory requirements
       Upon the request of any resident management corporation and public housing agency, and after notice and an opportunity to comment is afforded to the affected tenants, the Secretary may waive (for both the resident management corporation and the public housing agency) any requirement established by the Secretary (and not specified in any statute) that the Secretary determines to unnecessarily increase the costs or restrict the income of a public housing project.
    (2) Waiver to permit employment
       Upon the request of any resident management corporation, the Secretary may, subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, permit residents of such project to volunteer a portion of their labor.
    (3) Report on additional waivers
       Not later than 6 months after February 5, 1988, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report setting forth any additional waivers of Federal law that the Secretary determines are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section. In preparing the report, the Secretary shall consult with resident management corporations and public housing agencies.
    (4) Exceptions
       The Secretary may not waive under this subsection any requirement with respect to income eligibility for purposes of section 1437n of this title, rental payments under section 1437a(a) of this title, tenant or applicant protections, employee organizing rights, or rights of employees under collective bargaining agreements.
  (e) Operating subsidy and project income
    (1) Calculation of operating subsidy
       Notwithstanding any provision of section 1437g of this title or any regulation under such section, and subject to the exception provided in paragraph (3), the portion of the operating subsidy received by a public housing agency under section 1437g of this title that is allocated to a public housing project managed by a resident management corporation shall not be less than the public housing agency per unit monthly amount provided in the previous year as determined on an individual project basis.
    (2) Contract requirements
       Any contract for management of a public housing project entered into by a public housing agency and a resident management corporation shall specify the amount of income expected to be derived from the project itself (from sources such as rents and charges) and the amount of income funds to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the public housing agency (such as operating subsidy under section 1437g of this title, interest income, administrative fees, and rents).
    (3) Calculation of total income
      (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the amount of funds provided by a public housing agency to a public housing project managed by a resident management corporation may not be reduced during the 3-year period beginning on February 5, 1988, or on any later date on which a resident management corporation is first established for the project.
      (B) If the total income of a public housing agency (including the operating subsidy provided to the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title) is reduced or increased, the income provided by the public housing agency to a public housing project managed by a resident management corporation shall be reduced or increased in proportion to the reduction or increase in the total income of the public housing agency, except that any reduction in operating subsidy that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the public housing agency shall not affect the funds provided to the resident management corporation.
    (4) Retention of excess revenues
      (A) Any income generated by a resident management corporation of a public housing project that exceeds the income estimated for purposes of this subsection shall be excluded in subsequent years in calculating (i) the operating subsidies provided to the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title; and (ii) the funds provided by the public housing agency to the resident management corporation.
      (B) Any revenues retained by a resident management corporation under subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the public housing project, for establishing business enterprises that employ residents of public housing, or for acquiring additional dwelling units for low-income families.
  (f) Resident management technical assistance and training
    (1) Financial assistance
       To the extent budget authority is available for section 1437T3lK of this title, the Secretary shall provide financial assistance to resident management corporations or resident councils that obtain, by contract or otherwise, technical assistance for the development of resident management entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects, and the securing of such support.

     Not later than 3 years after February 5, 1988, the Secretary shall–
    (1) conduct an evaluation and assessment of resident management, and particularly of the effect of resident management on living conditions in public housing; and
