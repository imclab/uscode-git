   The Secretary shall ensure that the Federal Government establishes and carries out a program for the certification of training programs for technicians who are responsible for motor vehicle installation of equipment that converts gasoline or diesel-fueled motor vehicles into dedicated vehicles or dual fueled vehicles, and for the maintenance of such converted motor vehicles. A training program shall not be certified under the program established under this section unless it provides technicians with instruction on the proper and safe installation procedures and techniques, adherence to specifications (including original equipment manufacturer specifications), motor vehicle operating procedures, emissions testing, and other appropriate mechanical concerns applicable to these motor vehicle conversions. The Secretary shall ensure that, in the development of the program required under this section, original equipment manufacturers, fuel suppliers, companies that convert conventional vehicles to use alternative fuels, and other affected persons are consulted.
