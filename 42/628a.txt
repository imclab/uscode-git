   The Secretary may approve an application for a grant to a public or nonprofit institution for higher learning to provide traineeships with stipends under section 626(a)(1)(C) of this title only if the application–
  (1) provides assurances that each individual who receives a stipend with such traineeship (in this section referred to as a ””recipient““) will enter into an agreement with the institution under which the recipient agrees–
    (A) to participate in training at a public or private nonprofit child welfare agency on a regular basis (as determined by the Secretary) for the period of the traineeship;
    (B) to be employed for a period of years equivalent to the period of the traineeship, in a public or private nonprofit child welfare agency in any State, within a period of time (determined by the Secretary in accordance with regulations) after completing the postsecondary education for which the traineeship was awarded;
    (C) to furnish to the institution and the Secretary evidence of compliance with subparagraphs (A) and (B); and
    (D) if the recipient fails to comply with subparagraph (A) or (B) and does not qualify for any exception to this subparagraph which the Secretary may prescribe in regulations, to repay to the Secretary all (or an appropriately prorated part) of the amount of the stipend, plus interest, and, if applicable, reasonable collection fees (in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary);
  (2) provides assurances that the institution will–
    (A) enter into agreements with child welfare agencies for onsite training of recipients;
    (B) permit an individual who is employed in the field of child welfare services to apply for a traineeship with a stipend if the traineeship furthers the progress of the individual toward the completion of degree requirements; and
    (C) develop and implement a system that, for the 3-year period that begins on the date any recipient completes a child welfare services program of study, tracks the employment record of the recipient, for the purpose of determining the percentage of recipients who secure employment in the field of child welfare services and remain employed in the field.
