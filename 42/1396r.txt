    (6) Specification of resident assessment data set and instruments
       The Secretary shall–
      (A) not later than January 1, 1989, specify a minimum data set of core elements and common definitions for use by nursing facilities in conducting the assessments required under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and establish guidelines for utilization of the data set; and
      (B) by not later than April 1, 1990, designate one or more instruments which are consistent with the specification made under subparagraph (A) and which a State may specify under subsection (e)(5)(A) of this section for use by nursing facilities in complying with the requirements of subsection (b)(3)(A)(iii) of this section.
    (7) List of items and services furnished in nursing facilities not chargeable to the personal funds of a resident
      (A) Regulations required
         Pursuant to the requirement of section 21(b) of the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977, the Secretary shall issue regulations, on or before the first day of the seventh month to begin after December 22, 1987, that define those costs which may be charged to the personal funds of residents in nursing facilities who are individuals receiving medical assistance with respect to nursing facility services under this subchapter and those costs which are to be included in the payment amount under this subchapter for nursing facility services.
      (B) Rule if failure to publish regulations
         If the Secretary does not issue the regulations under subparagraph (A) on or before the date required in that subparagraph, in the case of a resident of a nursing facility who is eligible to receive benefits for nursing facility services under this subchapter, for purposes of section 1396a(a)(28)(B) of this title, the Secretary shall be deemed to have promulgated regulations under this paragraph which provide that the costs which may not be charged to the personal funds of such resident (and for which payment is considered to be made under this subchapter) include, at a minimum, the costs for routine personal hygiene items and services furnished by the facility.
    (8) Federal minimum criteria and monitoring for preadmission screening and resident review
      (A) Minimum criteria
         The Secretary shall develop, by not later than October 1, 1988, minimum criteria for States to use in making determinations under subsections (b)(3)(F) and (e)(7)(B) of this section and in permitting individuals adversely affected to appeal such determinations, and shall notify the States of such criteria.
      (B) Monitoring compliance
         The Secretary shall review, in a sufficient number of cases to allow reasonable inferences, each State“s compliance with the requirements of subsection (e)(7)(C)(ii) of this section (relating to discharge and placement for active treatment of certain residents).
    (9) Criteria for monitoring State waivers
       The Secretary shall develop, by not later than October 1, 1988, criteria and procedures for monitoring State performances in granting waivers pursuant to subsection (b)(4)(C)(ii) of this section.
  (g) Survey and certification process
    (1) State and Federal responsibility
      (A) In general
         Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of nursing facilities (other than facilities of the State) with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of State nursing facilities with the requirements of such subsections.
      (B) Educational program
         Each State shall conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of nursing facilities in order to present current regulations, procedures, and policies under this section.
      (C) Investigation of allegations of resident neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property
         The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing facilities under this subsection, for a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a resident in a nursing facility or by another individual used by the facility in providing services to such a resident. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that a nurse aide has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the nurse aide and the registry of such finding. If the State finds that any other individual used by the facility has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the appropriate licensure authority. A State shall not make a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the individual.
      (D) Construction
         The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.
    (2) Surveys
      (A) Annual standard survey
        (i) In general
           Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title. The Secretary shall review each State“s procedures for scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.
        (ii) Contents
           Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents–
          (I) a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,
          (II) written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section and an audit of the residents“ assessments under subsection (b)(3) of this section to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and
          (III) a review of compliance with residents“ rights under subsection (c) of this section.
        (iii) Frequency
          (I) In general
             Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this subparagraph. The statewide average interval between standard surveys of a nursing facility shall not exceed 12 months.
          (II) Special surveys
             If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a nursing facility, or director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.
      (B) Extended surveys
        (i) In general
           Each nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary“s or State“s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).
        (ii) Timing
           The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).
        (iii) Contents
           In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents“ assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.
        (iv) Construction
           Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) of this section on the basis of findings in a standard survey.
      (C) Survey protocol
         Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted–
        (i) based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than January 1, 1990, and
        (ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.
         The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary“s responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.
      (D) Consistency of surveys
         Each State shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.
      (E) Survey teams
        (i) In general
           Surveys under this subsection shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (including a registered professional nurse).
        (ii) Prohibition of conflicts of interest
           A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.
        (iii) Training
           The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.
    (3) Validation surveys
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State“s surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary“s determination as to the facility“s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.
      (B) Scope
         With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities in the State.
      (C) Reduction in administrative costs for substandard performance
         If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State“s survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary“s findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under section 1316 of this title in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary“s determination under section 1316(a)(1) of this title.
      (D) Special surveys of compliance
         Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the nursing facility meets such requirements.
    (4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring nursing facility compliance
       Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to–
      (A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities, and
      (B) monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a nursing facility“s compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if–
        (i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;
        (ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or
        (iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.
       A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard nursing facilities.
    (5) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities
      (A) Public information
         Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public–
        (i) information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,
        (ii) copies of cost reports of such facilities filed under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII of this chapter,
        (iii) copies of statements of ownership under section 1320a–3 of this title, and
        (iv) information disclosed under section 1320a–5 of this title.
      (B) Notice to ombudsman
         Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3021 et seq., 3058 et seq.] in accordance with section 712 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 3058g]) of the State“s findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or of any adverse action taken against a nursing facility under paragraphs \4\N (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (h) of this section, with respect to a nursing facility in the State.
      (C) Notice to physicians and nursing facility administrator licensing board
         If a State finds that a nursing facility has provided substandard quality of care, the State shall notify–
        (i) the attending physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made, and
        (ii) any State board responsible for the licensing of the nursing facility administrator of the facility.
      (D) Access to fraud control units
         Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1396b(q) of this title) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.
  (h) Enforcement process
    (1) In general
       If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility“s deficiencies–
      (A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii), or terminate the facility“s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (2); or
      (B) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may–
        (i) terminate the facility“s participation under the State plan,
        (ii) provide for one or more of the remedies described in paragraph (2), or
        (iii) do both.
       Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a nursing facility“s deficiencies. If a State finds that a nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.
    (2) Specified remedies
      (A) Listing
         Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedies:
        (i) Denial of payment under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to the nursing facility involved after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State.
        (ii) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty for activities described in subsections (b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (b)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (g)(2)(A)(i) of this section) shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.
        (iii) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility“s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while–
          (I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or
          (II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
              The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
        (iv) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to close the facility, to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities, or both.
         The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.
      (B) Deadline and guidance
        (i) Except as provided in clause (ii), as a condition for approval of a State plan for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1989, each State shall establish the remedies described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) by not later than October 1, 1989. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than October 1, 1988, guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.
        (ii) A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary“s satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).
      (C) Assuring prompt compliance
         If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.
      (D) Repeated noncompliance
         In the case of a nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the State shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)–
        (i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i), and
        (ii) monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B) of this section,
         until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the State, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.
      (E) Funding
         The reasonable expenditures of a State to provide for temporary management and other expenses associated with implementing the remedies described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a)(7) of this title, to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.
      (F) Incentives for high quality care
         In addition to the remedies specified in this paragraph, a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter. For purposes of section 1396b(a)(7) of this title, proper expenses incurred by a State in carrying out such a program shall be considered to be expenses necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan under this subchapter.
    (3) Secretarial authority
      (A) For State nursing facilities
         With respect to a State nursing facility, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a State under this subsection, including the authority to impose remedies described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).
      (B) Other nursing facilities
         With respect to any other nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and further finds that the facility“s deficiencies–
        (i) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (C)(iii), or terminate the facility“s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (C); or
        (ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (C).
         Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility“s deficiencies. If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.
      (C) Specified remedies
         The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:
        (i) Denial of payment
           The Secretary may deny any further payments to the State for medical assistance furnished by the facility to all individuals in the facility or to individuals admitted to the facility after the effective date of the finding.
        (ii) Authority with respect to civil money penalties
           The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.
        (iii) Appointment of temporary management
           In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility“s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while–
          (I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or
          (II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
              The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
         The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.
      (D) Continuation of payments pending remediation
         The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the effective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a nursing facility not in compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, if–
        (i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility,
        (ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and
        (iii) the State agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.
         The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States under this subparagraph.
    (4) Effective period of denial of payment
       A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the State or Secretary (or both, as the case may be) finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (5) Immediate termination of participation for facility where State or Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy
       If either the State or the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the State or the Secretary, respectively \5\N shall notify the other of such finding, and the State or the Secretary, respectively, shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) or (3)(C)(iii), or terminate the facility“s participation under the State plan. If the facility“s participation in the State plan is terminated by either the State or the Secretary, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under the State plan consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section.
    (6) Special rules where State and Secretary do not agree on finding of noncompliance
      (A) State finding of noncompliance and no Secretarial finding of noncompliance
         If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but a State finds that the facility has not met such requirements and the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State“s findings shall control and the remedies imposed by the State shall be applied.
      (B) Secretarial finding of noncompliance and no State finding of noncompliance
         If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, but the State has not made such a finding, the Secretary–
        (i) may impose any remedies specified in paragraph (3)(C) with respect to the facility, and
        (ii) shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D).
    (7) Special rules for timing of termination of participation where remedies overlap
       If both the Secretary and the State find that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and neither finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents–
      (A)        (i) if both find that the facility“s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State“s timing of any termination shall control so long as the termination date does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate;
        (ii) if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility“s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or
