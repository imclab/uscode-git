      (D) to accelerate the commercial demonstration of technologies for producing substitutes for natural gas, including coal gasification: T3ProvidedK, That the Secretary shall invite and consider proposals from potential participants based upon Federal assistance and participation in the form of a joint Federal-industry corporation, and recommendations pursuant to this clause shall be accompanied by a report on the viability of using this form of Federal assistance or participation;
      (E) to accelerate the commercial demonstration of technologies for producing syncrude and liquid petroleum products from coal: T3ProvidedK, That the Secretary shall invite and consider proposals from potential participants based upon Federal assistance and participation through guaranteed prices or purchase of the products, and recommendations pursuant to this clause shall be accompanied by a report on the viability of using this form of Federal assistance or participation;
      (F) in accordance with the program authorized by the Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–410) [30 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], to accelerate the commercial demonstration of geothermal energy technologies;
      (G) to demonstrate the production of syncrude from oil shale by all promising technologies including in situ technologies;
      (H) to demonstrate new and improved methods for the extraction of petroleum resources, including secondary and tertiary recovery of crude oil;
      (I) to demonstrate the economics and commercial viability of solar energy for residential and commercial energy supply applications in accordance with the program authorized by the Solar Heating and Cooling Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–409) [42 U.S.C. 5501 et seq.];
