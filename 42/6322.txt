      (B) utilization of adequate and reliable energy supplies, including greater energy efficiency, that meet applicable safety, environmental, and policy requirements at the lowest cost;
    (8) programs to promote energy efficiency in residential housing, such as–
      (A) programs for development and promotion of energy efficiency rating systems for newly constructed housing and existing housing so that consumers can compare the energy efficiency of different housing; and
      (B) programs for the adoption of incentives for builders, utilities, and mortgage lenders to build, service, or finance energy efficient housing;
    (9) programs to identify unfair or deceptive acts or practices which relate to the implementation of energy efficiency measures and renewable resource energy measures and to educate consumers concerning such acts or practices;
    (10) programs to modify patterns of energy consumption so as to reduce peak demands for energy and improve the efficiency of energy supply systems, including electricity supply systems;
    (11) programs to promote energy efficiency as an integral component of economic development planning conducted by State, local, or other governmental entities or by energy utilities;
    (12) in accordance with subsection (g) \2\N of this section, programs to implement the Energy Technology Commercialization Services Program;
