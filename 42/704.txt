  (a) In general
     A termination, suspension of payments, or suspension or debarment under this chapter may be waived by the head of an agency with respect to a particular contract or grant ifâ€“
    (1) in the case of a waiver with respect to a contract, the head of the agency determines under section 701(b)(1) of this title, after the issuance of a final determination under such section, that suspension of payments, or termination of the contract, or suspension or debarment of the contractor, or refusal to permit a person to be treated as a responsible source for a contract, as the case may be, would severely disrupt the operation of such agency to the detriment of the Federal Government or the general public; or
    (2) in the case of a waiver with respect to a grant, the head of the agency determines that suspension of payments, termination of the grant, or suspension or debarment of the grantee would not be in the public interest.
