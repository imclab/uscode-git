  (a) Allotments
    (1) In general
       For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations and this paragraph, allot the sums appropriated for such year under section 6030 of this title among the States on the basis of–
      (A) the population,
      (B) the extent of need for services for persons with developmental disabilities, and
      (C) the financial need,
       of the respective States. Sums allotted to the States under this section shall be used in accordance with approved State plans under section 6022 of this title for the provision under such plans of services for persons with developmental disabilities.
    (2) Adjustments
       Adjustments in the amounts of State allotments based on subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1) shall be made not more often than annually. The Secretary shall notify States of any adjustment made and the percentage of the total appropriation for each State not less than six months before the beginning of the fiscal year in which such adjustment is to take effect.
    (3) Minimum allotment for appropriations less than or equal to $75,000,000
      (A) In general
         Except as provided in paragraph (4), for any fiscal year the allotment under this section–
        (i) to each of American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Republic of Palau (until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect) may not be less than the greater of–
          (I) $210,000; or
          (II) the greater of the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1992, or the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1993, under this section (determined without regard to subsection (d) of this section); and
        (ii) to any State not described in clause (i), may not be less than the greater of–
          (I) $400,000; or
          (II) the greater of the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1992, or the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1993, under this section (determined without regard to subsection (d) of this section).
      (B) Reduction of allotment
         Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the aggregate of the amounts to be allotted to each State pursuant to subparagraph (A) in any fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for such fiscal year, the amount to be allotted to a State for such fiscal year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which is to be allotted to the State pursuant to such subparagraph as the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for such fiscal years bears to the total of the amount required to be appropriated under such section for allotments to provide each State with the allotment required by such subparagraph.
    (4) Minimum allotment for appropriations in excess of $75,000,000
      (A) In general
         In any case in which amounts appropriated under section 6030 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds $75,000,000, the allotment under this section for such fiscal year–
        (i) to each of American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the Republic of Palau (until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect) may not be less than the greater of–
          (I) $220,000; or
          (II) the greater of the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1992, or the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1993, under this section (determined without regard to subsection (d) of this section); and
        (ii) to any State not described in clause (i) may not be less than the greater of–
          (I) $450,000; or
          (II) the greater of the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1992, or the allotment received by such State for fiscal year 1993, under this section (determined without regard to subsection (d) of this section).
      (B) Reduction of allotment
         The requirements of paragraph (3)(B) shall apply with respect to amounts to be allotted to States under subparagraph (A), in the same manner and to the same extent as such requirements apply with respect to amounts to be allotted to States under paragraph (3)(A).
    (5) State supports, services, and other activities
       In determining, for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the extent of need in any State for services for persons with developmental disabilities, the Secretary shall take into account the scope and extent of the services described, pursuant to section 6022(c)(3)(A) of this title, in the State plan of the State.
    (6) Increase in allotments
       In any case in which the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under such section for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of title 29, the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments under paragraphs (3) and (4) by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph for prior fiscal years) as the amount which is equal to the difference between–
      (A) the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in minimum allotment is being made, minus
      (B) the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for the immediately preceding fiscal year,
       bears to the total amount appropriated under section 6030 of this title for such preceding fiscal year.
  (b) Unobligated funds
     Any amount paid to a State for a fiscal year and remaining unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such State for the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such amount was paid.
  (c) Obligation of funds
     For the purposes of this subchapter, State Interagency Agreements are considered valid obligations for the purpose of obligating Federal funds allotted to the State under this subchapter.
  (d) Cooperative efforts between States
     Whenever the State plan approved in accordance with section 6022 of this title provides for cooperative or joint effort between States or between or among agencies, public or private, in more than one State, portions of funds allotted to one or more such cooperating States may be combined in accordance with the agreements between the agencies involved.
  (e) Reallotments
     The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary from time to time, on such date or dates as the Secretary may fix (but not earlier than thirty days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make such reallotment in the Federal Register), to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year.
