     For purposes of this section–
    (1) the term ””specialized health resources““ means health care resources (whether equipment, space, or personnel) which, because of cost, limited availability, or unusual nature, are either unique in the health care community or are subject to maximum utilization only through mutual use;

  (b) Statement of purpose; agreements or arrangements; reciprocity; reimbursement; credits
     For the purpose of maintaining or improving the quality of care in Public Health Service facilities and to provide a professional environment therein which will help to attract and retain highly qualified and talented health personnel, to encourage mutually beneficial relationships between Public Health Service facilities and hospitals and other health facilities in the health care community, and to promote the full utilization of hospitals and other health facilities and resources, the Secretary may–
    (1) enter into agreements or arrangements with schools of medicine, schools of osteopathic medicine, and with other health professions schools, agencies, or institutions, for such interchange or cooperative use of facilities and services on a reciprocal or reimbursable basis, as will be of benefit to the training or research programs of the participating agencies; and
    (2) enter into agreements or arrangements with hospitals and other health care facilities for the mutual use or the exchange of use of specialized health resources, and providing for reciprocal reimbursement.
       Any reimbursement pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement shall be based on charges covering the reasonable cost of such utilization, including normal depreciation and amortization costs of equipment.
