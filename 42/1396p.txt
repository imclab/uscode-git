    (3) Any lien imposed with respect to an individual pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall dissolve upon that individual“s discharge from the medical institution and return home.
  (b) Adjustment or recovery of medical assistance correctly paid under a State plan
    (1) No adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made, except that the State shall seek adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan in the case of the following individuals:

          (II) because an individual has received (or is entitled to receive) benefits under a long-term care insurance policy.
    (2) Any adjustment or recovery under paragraph (1) may be made only after the death of the individual“s surviving spouse, if any, and only at a time–

          (I) the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the individual (or individual“s spouse) on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B)(i), divided by
          (II) the average monthly cost to a private patient of nursing facility services in the State (or, at the option of the State, in the community in which the individual is institutionalized) at the time of application.
        (ii) With respect to a noninstitutionalized individual, the number of months of ineligibility under this subparagraph for an individual shall not be greater than a number equal to–
          (I) the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the individual (or individual“s spouse) on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B)(i), divided by

        (iii) The number of months of ineligibility otherwise determined under clause (i) or (ii) with respect to the disposal of an asset shall be reduced–
          (I) in the case of periods of ineligibility determined under clause (i), by the number of months of ineligibility applicable to the individual under clause (ii) as a result of such disposal, and
          (II) in the case of periods of ineligibility determined under clause (ii), by the number of months of ineligibility applicable to the individual under clause (i) as a result of such disposal.
    (2) An individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of paragraph (1) to the extent that–

        (iv) a son or daughter of such individual (other than a child described in clause (ii)) who was residing in such individual“s home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual becomes an institutionalized individual, and who (as determined by the State) provided care to such individual which permitted such individual to reside at home rather than in such an institution or facility;
      (B) the assets–
        (i) were transferred to the individual“s spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual“s spouse,
        (ii) were transferred from the individual“s spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual“s spouse,

    (3) For purposes of this subsection, in the case of an asset held by an individual in common with another person or persons in a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or similar arrangement, the asset (or the affected portion of such asset) shall be considered to be transferred by such individual when any action is taken, either by such individual or by any other person, that reduces or eliminates such individual“s ownership or control of such asset.
    (4) A State (including a State which has elected treatment under section 1396a(f) of this title) may not provide for any period of ineligibility for an individual due to transfer of resources for less than fair market value except in accordance with this subsection. In the case of a transfer by the spouse of an individual which results in a period of ineligibility for medical assistance under a State plan for such individual, a State shall, using a reasonable methodology (as specified by the Secretary), apportion such period of ineligibility (or any portion of such period) among the individual and the individual“s spouse if the spouse otherwise becomes eligible for medical assistance under the State plan.

          (I) to or for the benefit of the individual, shall be considered income of the individual, and
          (II) for any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of assets by the individual subject to subsection (c) of this section; and
        (ii) any portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered, as of the date of establishment of the trust (or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed) to be assets disposed by the individual for purposes of subsection (c) of this section, and the value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of such subsection by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after such date.
