  (a) Each application made by a local unit of government, or a combination of units of local government, to a State for funds under this part shall be deemed approved, in whole or in part, by the State not later than 45 days after first received unless the State informs the applicant in writing of specific reasons for disapproval. The State shall not finally disapprove any application submitted to the State without first affording the applicant reasonable notice and opportunity for reconsideration.
  (b) Each State which receives funds under section 3756 of this title in a fiscal year shall make such funds available to local units of government, or combinations thereof, whose application has been submitted to, approved and awarded by the State, within 45 days after the Bureau has approved the State application and has made funds available to such State. The Director shall have the authority to waive the 45-day requirement in this section upon a finding that the State cannot satisfy that requirement consistent with State statutes.
