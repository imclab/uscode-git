    (4) Alcohol from biomass
      (A) In general, the goal of the Alcohol From Biomass Program shall be to advance research and development to a point where alcohol from biomass technology is cost-competitive with conventional hydrocarbon transportation fuels, and to promote the integration of this technology into the transportation fuel sector of the economy.
      (B)        (i) Specific goals for producing ethanol from biomass shall be to–
          (I) reduce the cost of alcohol to 70 cents per gallon;
          (II) improve the overall biomass carbohydrate conversion efficiency to 91 percent;
          (III) reduce the capital cost component of the cost of alcohol to 23 cents per gallon; and
