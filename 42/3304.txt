  (a) T4When Noncompetitive Procedures May Be UsedK.–An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when–
    (1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;
    (2) the executive agency“s need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;
    (3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source–
      (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization;
      (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;
      (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before a court, administrative tribunal, or agency, whether or not the expert is expected to testify; or
      (D) to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;
    (4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the Federal Government and a foreign government or an international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for that government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;
    (5) subject to section 3105 of this title, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency“s need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;
    (6) the disclosure of the executive agency“s needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or
    (7) the head of the executive agency (who may not delegate the authority under this paragraph)–
      (A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned; and
      (B) notifies Congress in writing of that determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.

    (1) a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services are deemed to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept, the substance of which is not otherwise available to the Federal Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; or
    (2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in–
      (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or
      (B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency“s needs.
  (c) T4Property or Services Needed With Unusual and Compelling Urgency.–

        (i) to meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and
        (ii) for the executive agency to enter into another contract for the required goods or services through the use of competitive procedures; and
      (B) may not exceed one year unless the head of the executive agency entering into the contract determines that exceptional circumstances apply.
    (2) T4Applicability of allowable contract periodK.–This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.
  (d) T4Offer Requests to Potential SourcesK.–An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of paragraph (2) or (6) of subsection (a) shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.

      (B) the justification is approved, in the case of a contract for an amount–
        (i) exceeding $500,000 but equal to or less than $10,000,000, by the advocate for competition for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii);
