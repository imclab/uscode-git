  (c) Other Federal assistance
    (1) Assessment criteria
       Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall, by contract with nonprofit organizations with expertise in process-oriented industrial energy efficiency technologies, establish and, as appropriate, update criteria for conducting process-oriented industrial assessments on an industry-by-industry basis. Such criteria shall be made available to State and local government, public utility commissions, utilities, representatives of affected process-oriented industries, and other interested parties.
    (2) Directory
