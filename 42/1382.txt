    (1) An individual“s eligibility for a benefit under this subchapter for a month shall be determined on the basis of the individual“s (and eligible spouse“s, if any) income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month, and, except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), the amount of such benefit shall be determined for such month on the basis of income and other characteristics in the first or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, second month preceding such month. Eligibility for and the amount of such benefits shall be redetermined at such time or times as may be provided by the Commissioner of Social Security.

      (B) in the case of the month in which an application becomes effective or the first month following a period of ineligibility, if such application becomes effective, or eligibility is restored, after the first day of such month, bear the same ratio to the amount of the benefit which would have been payable to such individual if such application had become effective, or eligibility had been restored, on the first day of such month as the number of days in such month including and following the effective date of such application or restoration of eligibility bears to the total number of days in such month.
    (3) For purposes of this subsection, an increase in the benefit amount payable under subchapter II of this chapter (over the amount payable in the preceding month, or, at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the second preceding month) to an individual receiving benefits under this subchapter shall be included in the income used to determine the benefit under this subchapter of such individual for any month which is–
      (A) the first month in which the benefit amount payable to such individual under this title is increased pursuant to section 1382f of this title, or
      (B) at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the month immediately following such month.
    (4)      (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that reliable information is currently available with respect to the income and other circumstances of an individual for a month (including information with respect to a class of which such individual is a member and information with respect to scheduled cost-of-living adjustments under other benefit programs), the benefit amount of such individual under this subchapter for such month may be determined on the basis of such information.
      (B) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe by regulation the circumstances in which information with respect to an event may be taken into account pursuant to subparagraph (A) in determining benefit amounts under this subchapter.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), any income which is paid to or on behalf of an individual in any month pursuant to (A) a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, (B) section 672 of this title (relating to foster care assistance), (C) section 1522(e) of title 8 (relating to assistance for refugees), (D) section 501(a) of Public Law 96-422 (relating to assistance for Cuban and Haitian entrants), or (E) section 13 of title 25 (relating to assistance furnished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs), shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under this subchapter of such individual (and his eligible spouse, if any) only for that month, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit for any other month.
    (6) The dollar amount in effect under subsection (b) of this section as a result of any increase in benefits under this subchapter by reason of section 1382f of this title shall be used to determine the value of any in-kind support and maintenance required to be taken into account in determining the benefit payable under this subchapter to an individual (and the eligible spouse, if any, of the individual) for the 1st 2 months for which the increase in benefits applies.
    (7) For purposes of this subsection, an application of an individual for benefits under this subchapter shall be effective on the later of–

    (8) The Commissioner of Social Security may waive the limitations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (e)(1) of this section on an individual“s eligibility and benefit amount for a month (to the extent either such limitation is applicable by reason of such individual“s presence throughout such month in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility) if such waiver would promote the individual“s removal from such institution or facility. Upon waiver of such limitations, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply, to the month preceding the month of removal, or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, the two months preceding the month of removal, the benefit rate that is appropriate to such individual“s living arrangement subsequent to his removal from such institution or facility.
  (d) Limitation on amount of gross income earned; ””gross income““ defined
     The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe the circumstances under which, consistently with the purposes of this subchapter, the gross income from a trade or business (including farming) will be considered sufficiently large to make an individual ineligible for benefits under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, the term ””gross income““ has the same meaning as when used in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

      (B) In any case where an eligible individual or his eligible spouse (if any) is, throughout any month (subject to subparagraph (G)), in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse) under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, or an eligible individual is a child described in section 1382c(f)(2)(B) of this title, or, in the case of an eligible individual who is a child under the age of 18, receiving payments (with respect to such individual) under any health insurance policy issued by a private provider of such insurance the benefit under this subchapter for such individual for such month shall be payable (subject to subparagraph (E))–
        (i) at a rate not in excess of $360 per year (reduced by the amount of any income not excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title) in the case of an individual who does not have an eligible spouse;
        (ii) in the case of an individual who has an eligible spouse, if only one of them is in such a hospital, home or facility throughout such month, at a rate not in excess of the sum of–
          (I) the rate of $360 per year (reduced by the amount of any income, not excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title, of the one who is in such hospital, home, or facility), and
          (II) the applicable rate specified in subsection (b)(1) of this section (reduced by the amount of any income, not excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title, of the other); and
        (iii) at a rate not in excess of $720 per year (reduced by the amount of any income not excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title) in the case of an individual who has an eligible spouse, if both of them are in such a hospital, home, or facility throughout such month.
           For purposes of this subsection, a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility which is a ””medical institution or nursing facility““ within the meaning of section 1396p(c) of this title shall be considered to be receiving payments with respect to an individual under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter during any period of ineligibility of such individual provided for under the State plan pursuant to section 1396p(c) of this title.
      (C) As used in subparagraph (A), the term ””public institution““ does not include a publicly operated community residence which serves no more than 16 residents.

      (E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), any individual who–
        (i)          (I) is an inmate of a public institution, the primary purpose of which is the provision of medical or psychiatric care, throughout any month as described in subparagraph (A), or

      (F) An individual who is an eligible individual or an eligible spouse for a month by reason of subparagraph (E) shall not be treated as being eligible under section 1382h(a) or (b) of this title for such month for purposes of clause (ii) of such subparagraph.
      (G) A person may be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter, and subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply, with respect to any particular month throughout which he or she is an inmate of a public institution the primary purpose of which is the provision of medical or psychiatric care, or which is a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse) under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, if it is determined in accordance with subparagraph (H) that–
        (i) such person“s stay in that institution or facility (or in that institution or facility and one or more other such institutions or facilities during a continuous period of institutionalization) is likely (as certified by a physician) not to exceed 3 months, and the particular month involved is one of the first 3 months throughout which such person is in such an institution or facility during a continuous period of institutionalization; and
        (ii) such person needs to continue to maintain and provide for the expenses of the home or living arrangement to which he or she may return upon leaving the institution or facility.
           The benefit of any person under this subchapter (including State supplementation if any) for each month to which this subparagraph applies shall be payable, without interruption of benefit payments and on the date the benefit involved is regularly due, at the rate that was applicable to such person in the month prior to the first month throughout which he or she is in the institution or facility.
      (H) The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish procedures for the determinations required by clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (G), and may enter into agreements for making such determinations (or for providing information or assistance in connection with the making of such determinations) with appropriate State and local public and private agencies and organizations. Such procedures and agreements shall include the provision of appropriate assistance to individuals who, because of their physical or mental condition, are limited in their ability to furnish the information needed in connection with the making of such determinations.
        (I)          (i) The Commissioner shall enter into an agreement, with any interested State or local institution described in clause (i) or (ii) of section 402(x)(1)(A) of this title the primary purpose of which is to confine individuals as described in section 402(x)(1)(A) of this title, under which–
            (I) the institution shall provide to the Commissioner, on a monthly basis and in a manner specified by the Commissioner, the names, social security account numbers, dates of birth, confinement commencement dates, and, to the extent available to the institution, such other identifying information concerning the inmates of the institution as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of carrying out paragraph (1); and
            (II) the Commissioner shall pay to any such institution, with respect to each inmate of the institution who is eligible for a benefit under this subchapter for the month preceding the first month throughout which such inmate is in such institution and becomes ineligible for such benefit as a result of the application of this subparagraph, $400 if the institution furnishes the information described in subclause (I) to the Commissioner within 30 days after the date such individual becomes an inmate of such institution, or $200 if the institution furnishes such information after 30 days after such date but within 90 days after such date.

          (iii) Payments to institutions required by clause (i)(II) shall be made from funds otherwise available for the payment of benefits under this subchapter and shall be treated as direct spending for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.].
    (2) No person shall be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter if, after notice to such person by the Commissioner of Social Security that it is likely that such person is eligible for any payments of the type enumerated in section 1382a(a)(2)(B) of this title, such person fails within 30 days to take all appropriate steps to apply for and (if eligible) obtain any such payments.
    (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the criteria being used by the Commissioner of Social Security in determining when a husband and wife are to be considered two eligible individuals for purposes of this subchapter and when they are to be considered an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, the State agency administering or supervising the administration of a State plan under any other program under this chapter may (in the administration of such plan) treat a husband and wife living in the same hospital, home, or facility described in paragraph (1)(B) as though they were an eligible individual with his or her eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter (rather than two eligible individuals), after they have continuously lived in the same such hospital, home, or facility for 6 months, if treating such husband and wife as two eligible individuals would prevent either of them from receiving benefits or assistance under such plan or reduce the amount thereof.
    (4)      (A) No person shall be considered an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter during the 10-year period that begins on the date the person is convicted in Federal or State court of having made a fraudulent statement or representation with respect to the place of residence of the person in order to receive assistance simultaneously from 2 or more States under programs that are funded under subchapter IV of this chapter, subchapter XIX of this chapter, or the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], or benefits in 2 or more States under the supplemental security income program under this subchapter.

      (A) fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which the person flees, for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees, or which, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of such State; or
      (B) violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.
    (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), the Commissioner shall furnish any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer, upon the written request of the officer, with the current address, Social Security number, and photograph (if applicable) of any recipient of benefits under this subchapter, if the officer furnishes the Commissioner with the name of the recipient, and other identifying information as reasonably required by the Commissioner to establish the unique identity of the recipient, and notifies the Commissioner that–
      (A) the recipient–
        (i) is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (5); and
        (ii) has information that is necessary for the officer to conduct the officer“s official duties; and

      (B) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that the absence of the individual from the United States will be–
        (i) for not more than 1 year; and
        (ii) for the purpose of conducting studies as part of an educational program that is–
          (I) designed to substantially enhance the ability of the individual to engage in gainful employment;
          (II) sponsored by a school, college, or university in the United States; and
          (III) not available to the individual in the United States.
