  (a) Duties and functions of Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy over projects
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of any financial assistance under this subchapter for a biomass energy project, the Secretary concerned shall be–
      (A) the Secretary of Agriculture, in the case of any biomass energy project which will have an anticipated annual production capacity of less than 15,000,000 gallons of ethanol (or the energy equivalent of other forms of biomass energy) and which will use feedstocks other than aquatic plants; and
      (B) the Secretary of Energy, in the case of any biomass energy project which will use aquatic plants as feedstocks or which will have an anticipated annual production capacity of 15,000,000 gallons or more of ethanol (or the energy equivalent of other forms of biomass energy).
    (2)      (A) Either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Energy may be the Secretary concerned in the case of any biomass energy project which will have an anticipated annual production capacity of 15,000,000 gallons or more of ethanol (or the energy equivalent of other forms of biomass energy) and–
        (i) which will use wood or wood wastes or residue, or
        (ii) which is owned and operated by a cooperative and will use feedstocks other than aquatic plants.
      (B) Financial assistance may not be provided by either Secretary under subparagraph (A) without the written concurrence of the other Secretary. Such concurrence shall be granted or denied by such Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (C) and on the same standards as that Secretary applies in making his own awards of financial assistance under this paragraph.
      (C)        (i) In the case of a project described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary concerned shall provide the other Secretary a copy of the application and such supporting information as may be material, and shall provide the other Secretary at least 15 days to review the project. If during such 15-day period the reviewing Secretary provides written notification to the Secretary concerned specifying reasons why such project should not proceed, the Secretary concerned shall defer the final decision on the application for an additional 30 days. During such 30-day period, both Secretaries shall attempt to reach agreement regarding all issues raised in the written notice. Before the end of the 30-day period, the reviewing Secretary shall notify the Secretary concerned of his decision regarding concurrence. If the reviewing Secretary fails to provide such notice before the end of such period, concurrence shall be deemed to have been given.
        (ii) The project applicant may reapply for financial assistance for such project, after making such modifications to the project as may be necessary to address issues raised by the reviewing Secretary in the original notice of objection. The subsequent review of such project by the reviewing Secretary shall be limited to the issues originally raised by the reviewing Secretary and any issues raised by changed circumstances.
      (D) Both Secretaries may jointly act as the Secretary concerned in accordance with such procedures as the Secretaries may jointly prescribe, in which case–
        (i) subparagraphs (B) and (C) and subsection (c) of this section shall not apply, and

      (A) guidelines for soliciting and receiving applications for financial assistance are established within 90 days after June 30, 1980;

        (ii) all such locations where such information is available will be able to accept and file applications, and will forward them to the Secretary concerned; and
        (iii) the procedures established for accepting, evaluating, and awarding financial assistance will provide for categories of biomass energy projects, according to size and provide to the maximum extent practicable the simplest procedures for small producers.
    (2) The procedural requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to either Secretary to the extent that the Secretary finds that other procedures are adopted for the solicitation, evaluation, and awarding of financial assistance which will result in applications being processed more expeditiously.
