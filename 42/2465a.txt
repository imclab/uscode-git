  (a) Use policy
    (1) It shall be the policy of the United States to use the Space Shuttle for purposes that (i) require the presence of man, (ii) require the unique capabilities of the Space Shuttle or (iii) when other compelling circumstances exist.
    (2) The term ””compelling circumstances““ includes, but is not limited to, occasions when the Administrator determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that important national security or foreign policy interests would be served by a Shuttle launch.
    (3) The policy stated in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not preclude the use of available cargo space, on a Space Shuttle mission otherwise consistent with the policy described under subsection (a)(1) of this section, for the purpose of carrying secondary payloads (as defined by the Administrator) that do not require the presence of man if such payloads are consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.
  (b) Implementation plan
     The Administrator shall, within six months after November 16, 1990, submit a report to the Congress setting forth a plan for the implementation of the policy described in subsection (a)(1) of this section. Such plan shall include–
    (1) details of the implementation plan;
    (2) a list of purposes that meet such policy;
    (3) a proposed schedule for the implementation of such policy;
    (4) an estimate of the costs to the United States of implementing such policy; and
    (5) a process for informing the Congress in a timely and regular manner of how the plan is being implemented.
  (c) Annual report
     At least annually, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report certifying that the payloads scheduled to be launched on the space shuttle for the next four years are consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section. For each payload scheduled to be launched from the space shuttle, which do not require the presence of man, the Administrator shall, in the certified report to Congress, state the specific circumstances which justified the use of the space shuttle. If, during the period between scheduled reports to the Congress, any additions are made to the list of certified payloads intended to be launched from the Shuttle, the Administrator shall inform the Congress of the additions and the reasons therefor within 45 days of the change.
  (d) NASA payloads
     The report described in subsection (c) of this section shall also include those National Aeronautics and Space Administration payloads designed solely to fly on the space shuttle which have begun the phase C/D of its development cycle.
