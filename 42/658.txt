  (a) Purpose; requirement; quarterly payments
     In order to encourage and reward State child support enforcement programs which perform in a cost-effective and efficient manner to secure support for all children who have sought assistance in securing support, whether such children reside within the State or elsewhere and whether or not they are eligible for aid to families with dependent children under a State plan approved under part A of this subchapter, and regardless of the economic circumstances of their parents, the Secretary shall, from support collected which would otherwise represent the Federal share of assistance to families of noncustodial parents, pay to each State for each fiscal year, on a quarterly basis (as described in subsection (e) of this section) beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1985, an incentive payment in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.
  (b) Incentive formula
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the incentive payment shall be equal to–
      (A) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected under the plan during the fiscal year in cases in which the support obligation involved is assigned to the State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) \1\N or section 671(a)(17) of this title (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State“s ””AFDC collections““ for that year), plus
      (B) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year in all other cases under this part (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State“s ””non-AFDC collections““ for that year).
    (2) If subsection (c) of this section applies with respect to a State“s AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year, the percent specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (B) (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to the higher percent determined under such subsection (with respect to such collections) in determining the State“s incentive payment under this subsection for that year.
    (3) The dollar amount of the portion of the State“s incentive payment for any fiscal year which is determined on the basis of its non-AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(B) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) shall in no case exceed–
      (A) the dollar amount of the portion of such payment which is determined on the basis of its AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(A) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) in the case of fiscal year 1986 or 1987;
      (B) 105 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1988;
      (C) 110 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1989; or
      (D) 115 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1990 or any fiscal year thereafter.
    (4) The Secretary shall make such additional payments to the State under this part, for fiscal year 1986 or 1987, as may be necessary to assure that the total amount of payments under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title for such fiscal year is no less than 80 percent of the amount that would have been payable to that State and its political subdivisions for such fiscal year under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title if those sections (including the amendment made by section 5(c)(2)(A) of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984) had remained in effect as they were in effect for fiscal year 1985.
  (c) Increase in percentage; laboratory costs
     If the total amount of a State“s AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year bears a ratio to the total amount expended by the State in that year for the operation of its plan approved under section 654 of this title for which payment may be made under section 655 of this title (with the total amount so expended in any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State“s ””combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs““ for that year) which is equal to or greater than 1.4, the relevant percent specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to–
    (1) 6.5 percent, plus
    (2) one-half of 1 percent for each full two-tenths by which such ratio exceeds 1.4;
       except that the percent so specified shall in no event be increased (for either AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections) to more than 10 percent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity in any fiscal year may at the option of the State be excluded from the State“s combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs for that year.
  (d) Support collected on behalf of individuals residing in another State
     In computing incentive payments under this section, support which is collected by one State at the request of another State shall be treated as having been collected in full by each such State, and any amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project assisted under section 655(e) of this title shall be excluded.
  (e) Estimates by Secretary; quarterly payments
     The amounts of the incentive payments to be made to the various States under this section for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the Secretary at or before the beginning of such year on the basis of the best information available. The Secretary shall make such payments for such year, on a quarterly basis (with each quarterly payment being made no later than the beginning of the quarter involved), in the amounts so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayments or underpayments which the Secretary determines were made under this section to the States involved for prior periods and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection. Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under the preceding sentence, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.
