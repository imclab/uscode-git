    (3) The Secretary shall, after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, approve any designation of an area under paragraph (1) only if–
      (A) the Governor of the State making the designation provides the Secretary in writing with the data and information on which such designation was made, together with such additional information as the Secretary may require to carry out the purposes of this section; and
