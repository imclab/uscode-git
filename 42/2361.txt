   The Commission may, in the sale of any single-family or duplex house to a priority purchaser, enter into a contract to purchase which provides that the purchaser shall conclude his purchase within not more than three years after the date the contract is entered into. Such contracts to purchase shall provide for such periodic payments, including payments on account of principal, interest, or tax equivalents, as the Commission shall prescribe.
