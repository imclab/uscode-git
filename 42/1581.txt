       Second, to families of other veterans and servicemen; and as among such families first preference shall be given to families of disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and second preference shall be given to families of deceased veterans and servicemen whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected: T3ProvidedK, That if the transferee is an educational institution it may limit such preferences to student veterans and servicemen, and their families, and may, in lieu of such preferences, make available to veterans or servicemen and their families accommodations in any housing of the institution equal in number to the accommodations relinquished or transferred to it: T3And provided furtherK, That, notwithstanding such preferences, if the transferee is a State, political subdivision, local housing authority, or local public agency, it will, in filling vacancies in housing transferred under subsection (b) of this section, give such preferences to military personnel and persons engaged in national defense or mobilization activities as the Secretary of Defense or his designee prescribes to such transferee.
    (2) Not to dispose of any right, title, or interest in the property (by sale, transfer, grant, exchange, mortgage, lease, release, termination of the leasehold, or any other relinquishment of interest) either (i) for housing use on the present site or on any other site except to a State or political subdivision thereof, local housing authority, a local public agency, or an educational or eleemosynary institution, or (ii) for any other use unless the governing body of the municipality or county shall have adopted a resolution determining that, on the basis of local need and acceptability, the structures involved are satisfactory for such use and need not be removed: T3ProvidedK, That this representation will not apply to any disposal through demolition for salvage, lease to tenants for residential occupancy, or lease of nondwelling facilities for the continuance of a use existing on the date of transfer, or where such disposal is the result of a bona fide foreclosure or other proceeding to enforce rights given as security for a loan to pay for land under this section: T3And provided furtherK, That nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as applicable to the disposition of any land or interest therein after the removal of the structures therefrom.
    (3) To manage and operate the property involved in accordance with sound business practices, including the establishment of adequate reserves.
    (4) Whenever the structures involved, or a substantial portion thereof, are terminated for housing use and are not to be used for a specific nonhousing use, to promptly demolish such structures terminated for housing use and clear the site thereof.
  (e) Waiver of removal requirements
     Any relinquishment or transfer by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under this section shall constitute a waiver of the requirements of section 1553 of this title (and any contractual obligations pursuant thereto) for removing the housing involved if the request for such relinquishment or transfer was made, as authorized herein, by the governing body of the municipality or county, or by the local housing authority, or, in other cases, if, prior to or within six months after the date of the relinquishment or transfer, there is filed with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development a resolution of such governing body specifically approving (1) the unconditional waiver of such requirements or (2) the waiver of such requirements subject to conditions specified in the resolution. Any such conditions shall not affect the waiver of removal requirements hereunder, and the United States shall assume no responsibility for compliance therewith.
  (f) Disposition of net revenue and proceeds; transfer charges
     In any relinquishment or transfer under this section, the net revenues and other proceeds from such housing to which the United States is entitled on the basis of periodic settlements shall continue to accrue to the United States until the end of the month in which the relinquishment or transfer is made, and the obligation of the transferee to pay such accrued amounts shall not be affected by this section.
