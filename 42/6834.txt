  (a) In general
    (1) Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, after consulting with appropriate Federal agencies, CABO, ASHRAE, the National Association of Home Builders, the Illuminating Engineering Society, the American Institute of Architects, the National Conference of the States on Building Codes and Standards, and other appropriate persons, shall establish, by rule, Federal building energy standards that require in new Federal buildings those energy efficiency measures that are technologically feasible and economically justified. Such standards shall become effective no later than 1 year after such rule is issued.
    (2) The standards established under paragraph (1) shall–
      (A) contain energy saving and renewable energy specifications that meet or exceed the energy saving and renewable energy specifications of CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 (in the case of residential buildings) or ASHRAE Standard 90.1–1989 (in the case of commercial buildings);
      (B) to the extent practicable, use the same format as the appropriate voluntary building energy code; and
      (C) consider, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies, and where appropriate contain, measures with regard to radon and other indoor air pollutants.
  (b) Report on comparative standards
     The Secretary shall identify and describe, in the report required under section 6837 of this title, the basis for any substantive difference between the Federal building energy standards established under this section (including differences in treatment of energy efficiency and renewable energy) and the appropriate voluntary building energy code.
  (c) Periodic review
     The Secretary shall periodically, but not less than once every 5 years, review the Federal building energy standards established under this section and shall, if significant energy savings would result, upgrade such standards to include all new energy efficiency and renewable energy measures that are technologically feasible and economically justified.
  (d) Interim standards
     Interim energy performance standards for new Federal buildings issued by the Secretary under this subchapter as it existed before October 24, 1992, shall remain in effect until the standards established under subsection (a) of this section become effective.
