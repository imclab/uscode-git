  (a) Preparation by Task Force for ten-year program; purposes
     The Task Force shall prepare a comprehensive research plan for the ten-year program (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the ””comprehensive plan““), setting forth a coordinated program (1) to identify the causes and effects of acid precipitation and (2) to identify actions to limit or ameliorate the harmful effects of acid precipitation.
  (b) Scope
     The comprehensive plan shall include programs for–
    (1) identifying the sources of atmospheric emissions contributing to acid precipitation;
    (2) establishing and operating a nationwide long-term monitoring network to detect and measure levels of acid precipitation;
    (3) research in atmospheric physics and chemistry to facilitate understanding of the processes by which atmospheric emissions are transformed into acid precipitation;
    (4) development and application of atmospheric transport models to enable prediction of long-range transport of substances causing acid precipitation;
    (5) defining geographic areas of impact through deposition monitoring, identification of sensitive areas, and identification of areas at risk;
    (6) broadening of impact data bases through collection of existing data on water and soil chemistry and through temporal trend analysis;
    (7) development of dose-response functions with respect to soils, soil organisms, aquatic and amphibious organisms, crop plants, and forest plants;
    (8) establishing and carrying out system studies with respect to plant physiology, aquatic ecosystems, soil chemistry systems, soil microbial systems, and forest ecosystems;
    (9) economic assessments of (A) the environmental impacts caused by acid precipitation on crops, forests, fisheries, and recreational and aesthetic resources and structures, and (B) alternative technologies to remedy or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects which may result from acid precipitation;
    (10) documenting all current Federal activities related to research on acid precipitation and ensuring that such activities are coordinated in ways that prevent needless duplication and waste of financial and technical resources;
    (11) effecting cooperation in acid precipitation research and development programs, ongoing and planned, with the affected and contributing States and with other sovereign nations having a commonality of interest;
    (12) subject to subsection (f)(1) of this section, management by the Task Force of financial resources committed to Federal acid precipitation research and development;
    (13) subject to subsection (f)(2) of this section, management of the technical aspects of Federal acid precipitation research and development programs, including but not limited to (A) the planning and management of research and development programs and projects, (B) the selection of contractors and grantees to carry out such programs and projects, and (C) the establishment of peer review procedures to assure the quality of research and development programs and their products; and
    (14) analyzing the information available regarding acid precipitation in order to formulate and present periodic recommendations to the Congress and the appropriate agencies about actions to be taken by these bodies to alleviate acid precipitation and its effects.
  (c) Procedures applicable
     The comprehensive plan–
    (1) shall be submitted in draft form to the Congress, and for public review, within six months after June 30, 1980;
    (2) shall be available for public comment for a period of sixty days after its submission in draft form under paragraph (1);
    (3) shall be submitted in final form, incorporating such needed revisions as arise from comments received during the review period, to the President and the Congress within forty-five days after the close of the period allowed for comments on the draft comprehensive plan under paragraph (2); and
    (4) shall constitute the basis on which requests for authorizations and appropriations are to be made for the nine fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the comprehensive plan is submitted in final form under paragraph (3).
  (d) Convening of Task Force
     The Task Force shall convene as necessary, but no less than twice during each fiscal year of the ten-year period covered by the comprehensive plan.
  (e) Submission of annual report to President and Congress by Task Force
     The Task Force shall submit to the President and the Congress by January 15 of each year an annual report which shall detail the progress of the research program under this subchapter and which shall contain such recommendations as are developed under subsection (b)(14) of this section.
  (f) Applicability of other statutory provisions to Task Force or plan
    (1) Subsection (b)(12) of this section shall not be construed as modifying, or as authorizing the Task Force or the comprehensive plan to modify, any provision of an appropriation Act (or any other provision of law relating to the use of appropriated funds) which specifies (A) the department or agency to which funds are appropriated, or (B) the obligations of such department or agency with respect to the use of such funds.
    (2) Subsection (b)(13) of this section shall not be construed as modifying, or as authorizing the Task Force or the comprehensive plan to modify, any provision of law (relating to or involving a department or agency) which specifies (A) procurement practices for the selection, award, or management of contracts or grants by such department or agency, or (B) program activities, limitations, obligations, or responsibilities of such department or agency.
