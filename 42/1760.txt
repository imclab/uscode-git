    (1)      (A) Except as provided in section 1759 of this title, in each fiscal year each State educational agency shall receive special assistance payments in an amount equal to the sum of the product obtained by multiplying the number of lunches (consisting of a combination of foods which meet the minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1758(a) of this title) served free to children eligible for such lunches in schools within that State during such fiscal year by the special assistance factor for free lunches prescribed by the Secretary for such fiscal year and the product obtained by multiplying the number of lunches served at a reduced price to children eligible for such reduced price lunches in schools within that State during such fiscal year by the special assistance factor for reduced price lunches prescribed by the Secretary for such fiscal year.
      (B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), (D), or (E), in the case of any school which determines that at least 80 percent of the children in attendance during a school year (hereinafter in this sentence referred to as the ””first school year““) are eligible for free lunches or reduced price lunches, special assistance payments shall be paid to the State educational agency with respect to that school, if that school so requests for the school year following the first school year, on the basis of the number of free lunches or reduced price lunches, as the case may be, that are served by that school during the school year for which the request is made, to those children who were determined to be so eligible in the first school year and the number of free lunches and reduced price lunches served during that year to other children determined for that year to be eligible for such lunches.
      (C)        (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), in the case of any school that–
          (I) elects to serve all children in the school free lunches under the school lunch program during any period of 3 successive school years, or in the case of a school that serves both lunches and breakfasts, elects to serve all children in the school free lunches and free breakfasts under the school lunch program and the school breakfast program established under section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) during any period of 3 successive school years; and

             special assistance payments shall be paid to the State educational agency with respect to the school during the period on the basis of the number of lunches or breakfasts determined under clause (ii) or (iii).
        (ii) For purposes of making special assistance payments under clause (i), except as provided in clause (iii), the number of lunches or breakfasts served by a school to children who are eligible for free lunches or breakfasts or reduced price lunches or breakfasts during each school year of the 3-school-year period shall be considered to be equal to the number of lunches or breakfasts served by the school to children eligible for free lunches or breakfasts or reduced price lunches or breakfasts during the first school year of the period.
        (iii) For purposes of computing the amount of the payments, a school may elect to determine on a more frequent basis the number of children who are eligible for free or reduced price lunches or breakfasts who are served lunches or breakfasts during the 3-school-year period.
      (D)        (i) In the case of any school that is receiving special assistance payments under this paragraph for a 3-school-year period described in subparagraph (C), the State may grant, at the end of the 3-school-year period, an extension of the period for an additional 2 school years, if the State determines, through available socioeconomic data approved by the Secretary, that the income level of the population of the school has remained stable.
        (ii) A school described in clause (i) may reapply to the State at the end of the 2-school-year period described in clause (i) for the purpose of continuing to receive special assistance payments, as determined in accordance with this paragraph, for a subsequent 5-school-year period. The school may reapply to the State at the end of the 5-school-year period, and at the end of each 5-school-year period thereafter for which the school receives special assistance payments under this paragraph, for the purpose of continuing to receive the payments for a subsequent 5-school-year period.
        (iii) If the Secretary determines after considering the best available socioeconomic data that the income level of families of children enrolled in a school has not remained stable, the Secretary may require the submission of applications for free and reduced price lunches, or for free and reduced price lunches and breakfasts, in the first school year of any 5-school-year period for which the school receives special assistance payments under this paragraph, for the purpose of calculating the special assistance payments.
        (iv) For the purpose of updating information and reimbursement levels, a school described in clause (i) that carries out a school lunch or school breakfast program may at any time require submission of applications for free and reduced price lunches or for free and reduced price lunches and breakfasts.

             total Federal cash reimbursements and total commodity assistance shall be provided to the State educational agency with respect to the school at a level that is equal to the total Federal cash reimbursements and total commodity assistance received by the school in the last school year for which the school accepted applications under the school lunch or school breakfast program, adjusted annually for inflation in accordance with paragraph (3)(B) and for changes in enrollment, to carry out the school lunch or school breakfast program.
        (ii) A school described in clause (i) may reapply to the State at the end of the 4-school-year period described in clause (i), and at the end of each 4-school-year period thereafter for which the school receives reimbursements and assistance under this subparagraph, for the purpose of continuing to receive the reimbursements and assistance for a subsequent 4-school-year period. The State may approve an application under this clause if the State determines, through available socioeconomic data approved by the Secretary, that the income level of the population of the school has remained consistent with the income level of the population of the school in the last school year for which the school accepted the applications described in clause (i).

        (iv) The national average payment rates for supplements (as established under section 1766(c) of this title).
      (B) The annual adjustment under this paragraph shall reflect changes in the cost of operating meal programs under this chapter and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.], as indicated by the change in the series for food away from home of the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. Each annual adjustment shall reflect the changes in the series for food away from home for the most recent 12-month period for which such data are available. The adjustments made under this paragraph shall be computed to the nearest one-fourth cent, except that adjustments to payment rates for meals and supplements served to individuals not determined to be eligible for free or reduced price meals and supplements shall be computed to the nearest lower cent increment and based on the unrounded amount for the preceding 12-month period.
