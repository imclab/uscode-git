  (a) In general
     The Comptroller General of the United States shall carry out a study of ways in which financing for affordable housing may be made available to assist in the most efficient implementation of comprehensive housing affordability strategies of participating jurisdictions. In conducting the study, the Comptroller General shall draw upon the expertise of such representatives of State and local government, State and local housing finance agencies, agencies of the United States, government-sponsored mortgage finance corporations, for-profit and nonprofit housing developers, private financial institutions, and sources of long-term mortgage investment, as the Comptroller General determines to be appropriate.
  (b) Report
     Not later than one year after November 28, 1990, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Congress and the Secretary a report containing any recommendations for legislative or administrative actions needed to improve the availability of mortgage finance for affordable housing. The report shall include, but need not be limited to, an assessment of–
    (1) the need for the Department of Housing and Urban Development or other agencies of the United States to provide partial credit enhancement to make financing for affordable housing available efficiently and at the lowest possible cost; and
    (2) alternative ways in which–
      (A) the Department could provide any needed credit enhancement on a one-stop basis for participating jurisdictions, in coordination with other forms of assistance under this part;
      (B) the Department or other agencies of the Federal Government could assist government-sponsored mortgage finance corporations in the financing of mortgages on affordable housing through the development of mortgage-backed securities that are more standardized and readily traded in the capital markets;
      (C) the capacities of existing agencies of the United States could be used to provide mortgage finance more efficiently for affordable housing through government-sponsored mortgage finance corporations; and
      (D) the interests of the Federal Government could be protected and any risks of loss could be minimized through requirements for fees, mortgage insurance, risk-sharing, secure collateral, and guarantees by other parties, and through standards relating to minimum capital and prior experience with underwriting, origination and servicing.
