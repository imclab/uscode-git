     When the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that any housing provided under this subchapter is no longer required for persons engaged in national defense activities, preference in admission to occupancy thereof shall be given to veterans pending its ultimate sale or disposition in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. As among veterans, preference in admission to occupancy shall be given to disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected.
