   The Secretary may, after consultation with the appropriate State agency, make grants to pay for part or all of the costs of developing model projects which show promise of relieving older individuals of the excessive burdens of high utility service and home heating costs. Any such project shall give special consideration to projects under which a business concern is engaged in providing home heating oil or utility services to low-income older individuals at a cost which is substantially lower than providing home heating oil or utility services to other individuals.
