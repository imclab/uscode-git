  (b) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support
     The procedures referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section (relating to the withholding from income of amounts payable as support) must provide for the following:

      (B) The income of a noncustodial parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of income not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of–
        (i) the date as of which the noncustodial parent requests that such withholding begin,
        (ii) the date as of which the custodial parent requests that such withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved, or
        (iii) such earlier date as the State may select.
    (4)      (A) Such withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State, and the State must send notice to each noncustodial parent to whom paragraph (1) applies–
        (i) that the withholding has commenced; and
        (ii) of the procedures to follow if the noncustodial parent desires to contest such withholding on the grounds that the withholding or the amount withheld is improper due to a mistake of fact.
      (B) The notice under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall include the information provided to the employer under paragraph (6)(A).
    (5) Such withholding must be administered by the State through the State disbursement unit established pursuant to section 654b of this title, in accordance with the requirements of section 654b of this title.
    (6)      (A)        (i) The employer of any noncustodial parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such noncustodial parent“s income the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the State disbursement unit within 7 business days after the date the amount would (but for this subsection) have been paid or credited to the employee, for distribution in accordance with this part. The employer shall withhold funds as directed in the notice, except that when an employer receives an income withholding order issued by another State, the employer shall apply the income withholding law of the state \3\N of the obligor“s principal place of employment in determining–
          (I) the employer“s fee for processing an income withholding order;
          (II) the maximum amount permitted to be withheld from the obligor“s income;
          (III) the time periods within which the employer must implement the income withholding order and forward the child support payment;
          (IV) the priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees; and
          (V) any withholding terms or conditions not specified in the order.

        (ii) The notice given to the employer shall be in a standard format prescribed by the Secretary, and contain only such information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order.
        (iii) As used in this subparagraph, the term ””business day““ means a day on which State offices are open for regular business.
      (B) Methods must be established by the State to simplify the withholding process for employers to the greatest extent possible, including permitting any employer to combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to each appropriate agency or entity (with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual employee being separately designated).
      (C) The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from income due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.
      (D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who–
