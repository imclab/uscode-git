  (a) Initial classifications
     Every area designated nonattainment for PM–10 pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title shall be classified at the time of such designation, by operation of law, as a moderate PM–10 nonattainment area (also referred to in this subpart as a ””Moderate Area““) at the time of such designation. At the time of publication of the notice under section 7407(d)(4) of this title (relating to area designations) for each PM–10 nonattainment area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the classification of such area. The provisions of section 7502(a)(1)(B) of this title (relating to lack of notice-and-comment and judicial review) shall apply with respect to such classification.
  (b) Reclassification as Serious
    (1) Reclassification before attainment date
       The Administrator may reclassify as a Serious PM–10 nonattainment area (identified in this subpart also as a ””Serious Area““) any area that the Administrator determines cannot practicably attain the national ambient air quality standard for PM–10 by the attainment date (as prescribed in subsection (c) of this section) for Moderate Areas. The Administrator shall reclassify appropriate areas as Serious by the following dates:
      (A) For areas designated nonattainment for PM–10 under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, the Administrator shall propose to reclassify appropriate areas by June 30, 1991, and take final action by December 31, 1991.
      (B) For areas subsequently designated nonattainment, the Administrator shall reclassify appropriate areas within 18 months after the required date for the State“s submission of a SIP for the Moderate Area.
    (2) Reclassification upon failure to attain
       Within 6 months following the applicable attainment date for a PM–10 nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine whether the area attained the standard by that date. If the Administrator finds that any Moderate Area is not in attainment after the applicable attainment date–
      (A) the area shall be reclassified by operation of law as a Serious Area; and
      (B) the Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register no later than 6 months following the attainment date, identifying the area as having failed to attain and identifying the reclassification described under subparagraph (A).
  (c) Attainment dates
     Except as provided under subsection (d) of this section, the attainment dates for PM–10 nonattainment areas shall be as follows:
    (1) Moderate Areas
       For a Moderate Area, the attainment date shall be as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the sixth calendar year after the area“s designation as nonattainment, except that, for areas designated nonattainment for PM–10 under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, the attainment date shall not extend beyond December 31, 1994.
    (2) Serious Areas
       For a Serious Area, the attainment date shall be as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the tenth calendar year beginning after the area“s designation as nonattainment, except that, for areas designated nonattainment for PM–10 under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, the date shall not extend beyond December 31, 2001.
  (d) Extension of attainment date for Moderate Areas
     Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the ””Extension Year““) the date specified in paragraph \1\N (c)(1) if–
    (1) the State has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementation plan; and
    (2) no more than one exceedance of the 24-hour national ambient air quality standard level for PM–10 has occurred in the area in the year preceding the Extension Year, and the annual mean concentration of PM–10 in the area for such year is less than or equal to the standard level.
       No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under the subsection for a single nonattainment area.
  (e) Extension of attainment date for Serious Areas
     Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend the attainment date for a Serious Area beyond the date specified under subsection (c) of this section, if attainment by the date established under subsection (c) of this section would be impracticable, the State has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to that area in the implementation plan, and the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the plan for that area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can feasibly be implemented in the area. At the time of such application, the State must submit a revision to the implementation plan that includes a demonstration of attainment by the most expeditious alternative date practicable. In determining whether to grant an extension, and the appropriate length of time for any such extension, the Administrator may consider the nature and extent of nonattainment, the types and numbers of sources or other emitting activities in the area (including the influence of uncontrollable natural sources and transboundary emissions from foreign countries), the population exposed to concentrations in excess of the standard, the presence and concentration of potentially toxic substances in the mix of particulate emissions in the area, and the technological and economic feasibility of various control measures. The Administrator may not approve an extension until the State submits an attainment demonstration for the area. The Administrator may grant at most one such extension for an area, of no more than 5 years.
  (f) Waivers for certain areas
     The Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive any requirement applicable to any Serious Area under this subpart where the Administrator determines that anthropogenic sources of PM–10 do not contribute significantly to the violation of the PM–10 standard in the area. The Administrator may also waive a specific date for attainment of the standard where the Administrator determines that nonanthropogenic sources of PM–10 contribute significantly to the violation of the PM–10 standard in the area.
