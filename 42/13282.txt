     In selecting a proposal and in negotiating financial assistance under this section, the Secretary shall consider–
    (1) the ability of the manufacturer, directly, indirectly, or in combination with the proposer, to develop, assist in the demonstration of, manufacture, distribute, sell, provide warranties for, service, and ensure the continued availability of parts for, electric motor vehicles in the demonstration project;
    (2) the geographic and climatic diversity of the eligible metropolitan area or areas in which the demonstration project is to be undertaken, when considered in combination with other proposals and other selected demonstration projects;
    (3) the long-term technical and competitive viability of the electric motor vehicles;
    (4) the suitability of the electric motor vehicles for their intended uses;
    (5) the environmental effects of the use of the proposed electric motor vehicles;
    (6) the price differential and the proposed discount payment;
    (7) the extent of involvement of State or local government and other persons in the demonstration project, and whether such involvement will–
      (A) permit a reduction of the Federal cost share per vehicle; or
      (B) otherwise be used to allow the Federal contribution to be provided for a greater number of electric motor vehicles;
    (8) the proportion of domestic content of the electric motor vehicles and associated equipment;

    (3) in the case of a demonstration project including automobiles or light duty trucks, the number of electric motor vehicles to be included in the demonstration project shall be no less than 50, except that the Secretary may select a demonstration project with fewer than 50 electric motor vehicles if the Secretary determines that selection of such a proposal will ensure that there is geographic or climatic diversity among the proposals selected and that an adequate demonstration to accelerate the development and use of electric motor vehicles can be undertaken with fewer than 50 electric motor vehicles; and
    (4) the procurement practices of the manufacturer do not discriminate against United States producers of vehicle parts.
