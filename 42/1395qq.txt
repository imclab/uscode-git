     A hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service, whether operated by such Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are defined in section 1603 of title 25), shall be eligible for payments under this subchapter, notwithstanding sections 1395f(c) and 1395n(d) of this title, if and for so long as it meets all of the conditions and requirements for such payments which are applicable generally to hospitals or skilled nursing facilities (as the case may be) under this subchapter.
  (b) Eligibility based on submission of plan to achieve compliance with conditions and requirements; twelve-month period
     Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service which does not meet all of the conditions and requirements of this subchapter which are applicable generally to hospitals or skilled nursing facilities (as the case may be), but which submits to the Secretary within six months after September 30, 1976, an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with such conditions and requirements, shall be deemed to meet such conditions and requirements (and to be eligible for payments under this subchapter), without regard to the extent of its actual compliance with such conditions and requirements, during the first 12 months after the month in which such plan is submitted.
  (c) Payments into special fund for improvements to achieve compliance with conditions and requirements; certification of compliance by Secretary
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payments to which any hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service is entitled by reason of this section shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the Secretary and used by him (to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts) exclusively for the purpose of making any improvements in the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service which may be necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of this subchapter. The preceding sentence shall cease to apply when the Secretary determines and certifies that substantially all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service in the United States are in compliance with such conditions and requirements.
