Members of such advisory committees, other than full-time employees of the Federal Government, while attending meetings of such committees or while otherwise serving at the request of the Secretary while serving away from their homes or regular places of business, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for individuals in the Government serving without pay.
  (b) Section 776 of title 15 shall be applicable to advisory committees chartered by the Secretary, or transferred to the Secretary or the Department under this chapter, except that where an advisory committee advises the Secretary on matters pertaining to research and development, the Secretary may determine that such meeting shall be closed because it involves research and development matters and comes within the exemption of section 552b(c)(4) of title 5.
