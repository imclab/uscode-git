   The Secretary shall conduct an annual review of all areas designated in accordance with section 3161 of this title, and on the basis of such reviews shall terminate or modify such designation whenever such an area no longer satisfies the designation requirements of section 3161 of this title, but in no event shall such a designation of an area be terminated prior to the expiration of the third year after the date such area was so designated. No area previously designated shall retain its designated status unless it maintains a currently approved overall economic development program in accordance with section 3142(b)(10) of this title. No termination of eligibility shall (1) be made without thirty daysâ€œ prior notification to the area concerned, (2) affect the validity of any application filed, or contract or undertaking entered into, with respect to such area pursuant to this chapter prior to such termination, (3) prevent any such area from again being designated a redevelopment area under section 3161 of this title if the Secretary determines it to be eligible under such section, or (4) be made in the case of any designated area where the Secretary determines that an improvement in the unemployment rate of a designated area is primarily the result of increased employment in occupations not likely to be permanent. The Secretary shall keep the departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and interested State or local agencies, advised at all times of any changes made hereunder with respect to the classification of any area.
