  (a) Refusal to approve application; procedure; jurisdiction of court of appeals
     If the Surgeon General refuses to approve any application for a project submitted under section 291e of this title or section 291j of this title, the State agency through which such application was submitted, or if any State is dissatisfied with his action under section 291g of this title such State may appeal to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located, by filing a petition with such court within sixty days after such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Surgeon General, or any officer designated by him for that purpose. The Surgeon General shall thereupon file in the court the record of the proceedings on which he based his action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Surgeon General or to set it aside, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, but until the filing of the record, the Surgeon General may modify or set aside his order.
  (b) Conclusiveness of Surgeon General“s findings; remand; new or modified findings
     The findings of the Surgeon General as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Surgeon General to take further evidence, and the Surgeon General may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify his previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.
  (c) Review by Supreme Court; stay of Surgeon General“s action
     The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any action of the Surgeon General shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28. The commencement of proceedings under this section shall not, unless so specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Surgeon General“s action.
