     The Commission is authorized to issue licenses to persons applying therefor to transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, use, import, or export under the terms of an agreement for cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of this title, utilization or production facilities for industrial or commercial purposes.

All such information may be used by the Commission only for the purposes of the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public.
  (c) License period
