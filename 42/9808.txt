  (a)    (1) Assistance provided under this subchapter to any program described in section 9807(a) of this title shall not exceed 90 percent of the cost of such program, including costs of administration, unless the Secretary determines that the assistance in excess of such percentage is required in furtherance of the purposes of this subchapter. Non-Federal contributions may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including but not limited to plant, equipment, and services.
    (2) The assistance referred to in paragraph (1) shall be made available (A) for deposit to the order of grantees which have demonstrated successful program performance, under conditions which the Secretary deems appropriate, within 30 days following approval of the grant agreement by the Secretary and such grantee; or (B) whenever the Secretary deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and including any other conditions which the Secretary of Health and Human Services deems appropriate, within 30 days following approval of the grant agreement by the Secretary and such grantee.
  (b) Property acquired as a result of capital investments made by any community development corporation with funds granted as its Federal share of the cost of programs carried out under this subchapter, and the proceeds from such property, shall become the property of the community development corporation and shall not be considered to be Federal property. The Federal Government retains the right to direct that on severance of the grant relationship the assets purchased with grant funds shall continue to be used for the original purpose for which they were granted.
