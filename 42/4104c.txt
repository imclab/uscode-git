    (3) Limitations
      (A) Timing
         A grant under this subsection may be awarded to a State or community not more than once every 5 years and each grant may cover a period of 1 to 3 years.

  (c) Eligibility for mitigation assistance
     To be eligible to receive financial assistance under this section for mitigation activities, a State or community shall develop, and have approved by the Director, a flood risk mitigation plan (in this section referred to as a ””mitigation plan““), that describes the mitigation activities to be carried out with assistance provided under this section, is consistent with the criteria established by the Director under section 4102 of this title, and provides protection against flood losses to structures for which contracts for flood insurance are available under this chapter. The mitigation plan shall be consistent with a comprehensive strategy for mitigation activities for the area affected by the mitigation plan, that has been adopted by the State or community following a public hearing.
  (d) Notification of approval and grant award
    (1) In general
       The Director shall notify a State or community submitting a mitigation plan of the approval or disapproval of the plan not later than 120 days after submission of the plan.
    (2) Notification of disapproval
       If the Director does not approve a mitigation plan submitted under this subsection, the Director shall notify, in writing, the State or community submitting the plan of the reasons for such disapproval.
  (e) Eligible mitigation activities
    (1) Use of amounts
       Amounts provided under this section (other than under subsection (b) of this section) may be used only for mitigation activities specified in a mitigation plan approved by the Director under subsection (d) of this section. The Director shall provide assistance under this section to the extent amounts are available in the National Flood Mitigation Fund pursuant to appropriation Acts, subject only to the absence of approvable mitigation plans.
    (2) Determination of eligible plans
       The Director may approve only mitigation plans that specify mitigation activities that the Director determines are technically feasible and cost-effective and only such plans that propose activities that are cost-beneficial to the National Flood Mitigation Fund.
    (3) Standard for approval
       The Director shall approve mitigation plans meeting the requirements for approval under paragraph (1) that will be most cost-beneficial to the National Flood Mitigation Fund.
    (4) Priority
       The Director shall make every effort to provide mitigation assistance under this section for mitigation plans proposing activities for repetitive loss structures and structures that have incurred substantial damage.
    (5) Eligible activities
       The Director shall determine whether mitigation activities described in a mitigation plan submitted under subsection (d) of this section comply with the requirements under paragraph (1). Such activities may include–
      (A) demolition or relocation of any structure located on land that is along the shore of a lake or other body of water and is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or flooding;
      (B) elevation, relocation, demolition, or floodproofing of structures (including public structures) located in areas having special flood hazards or other areas of flood risk;
      (C) acquisition by States and communities of properties (including public properties) located in areas having special flood hazards or other areas of flood risk and properties substantially damaged by flood, for public use, as the Director determines is consistent with sound land management and use in such area;
      (D) minor physical mitigation efforts that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies and that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, which shall not include major flood control projects such as dikes, levees, seawalls, groins, and jetties unless the Director specifically determines in approving a mitigation plan that such activities are the most cost-effective mitigation activities for the National Flood Mitigation Fund;
      (E) beach nourishment activities;
      (F) the provision of technical assistance by States to communities and individuals to conduct eligible mitigation activities;
      (G) other activities that the Director considers appropriate and specifies in regulation; and
      (H) other mitigation activities not described in subparagraphs (A) through (F) or the regulations issued under subparagraph (G), that are described in the mitigation plan of a State or community.
  (f) Limitations on amount of assistance
    (1) Amount
       The sum of the amounts of mitigation assistance provided under this section during any 5-year period may not exceed–
      (A) $10,000,000, to any State; or

    (3) Waiver
       The Director may waive the dollar amount limitations under paragraphs (1) and (2) for any State or community for any 5-year period during which a major disaster or emergency declared by the President (pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.]) as a result of flood conditions is in effect with respect to areas in the State or community.
  (g) Matching requirement
    (1) In general
       The Director may not provide mitigation assistance under this section to a State or community in an amount exceeding 3 times the amount that the State or community certifies, as the Director shall require, that the State or community will contribute from non-Federal funds to develop a mitigation plan under subsection (c) of this section and to carry out mitigation activities under the approved mitigation plan. In no case shall any in-kind contribution by any State or community exceed one-half of the amount of non-Federal funds contributed by the State or community.

  (h) Oversight of mitigation plans
     The Director shall conduct oversight of recipients of mitigation assistance under this section to ensure that the assistance is used in compliance with the approved mitigation plans of the recipients and that matching funds certified under subsection (g) of this section are used in accordance with such certification.
    (i) Recapture

       For purposes of this section, the term ””community““ means–
      (1) a political subdivision that (A) has zoning and building code jurisdiction over a particular area having special flood hazards, and (B) is participating in the national flood insurance program; or
