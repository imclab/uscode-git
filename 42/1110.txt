  (a) In general
     Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the Secretary of Labor) determines that–
    (1) the amount in the employment security administration account, Federal unemployment account, or extended unemployment compensation account, is insufficient to meet the anticipated payments from the account,
    (2) such insufficiency may cause such account to borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, and
    (3) the amount in any other such account exceeds the amount necessary to meet the anticipated payments from such other account,
       the Secretary shall transfer to the account referred to in paragraph (1) from the account referred to \1\N paragraph (3) an amount equal to the insufficiency determined under paragraph (1) (or, if less, the excess determined under paragraph (3)).

  (c) Repayment
     Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the Secretary of Labor) determines that the amount in the account to which an advance is made under subsection (a) of this section exceeds the amount necessary to meet the anticipated payments from the account, the Secretary shall transfer from the account to the account from which the advance was made an amount equal to the lesser of the amount so advanced or such excess.
