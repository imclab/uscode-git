Such application shall include a plan for addressing the problem of drug-related crime on the premises of the housing administered or owned by the applicant for which the application is being submitted.
  (b) Criteria
     Except as provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section the Secretary shall approve applications under this subchapter based exclusively on–

     In addition to the selection criteria specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may establish other criteria for the evaluation of applications submitted by owners of federally assisted low-income housing, except that such additional criteria shall be designed only to reflect–
    (1) relevant differences between the financial resources and other characteristics of public housing authorities and owners of federally assisted low-income housing, or
    (2) relevant differences between the problem of drug-related crime in public housing and the problem of drug-related crime in federally assisted low-income housing.
  (d) High intensity drug trafficking areas
     In evaluating the extent of the drug-related crime problem pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may consider whether housing projects proposed for assistance are located in a high intensity drug trafficking area designated pursuant to section 1504 of title 21.
