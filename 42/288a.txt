  (a) The Secretary may make awards (hereafter in this section referred to as ””Visiting Scientist Awards““) to outstanding scientists who agree to serve as visiting scientists at institutions of postsecondary education which have significant enrollments of disadvantaged students. Visiting Scientist Awards shall be made by the Secretary to enable the faculty and students of such institutions to draw upon the special talents of scientists from other institutions for the purpose of receiving guidance, advice, and instruction with regard to research, teaching, and curriculum development in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and such other aspects of these sciences as the Secretary shall deem appropriate.
  (b) The amount of each Visiting Scientist Award shall include such sum as shall be commensurate with the salary or remuneration which the individual receiving the award would have been entitled to receive from the institution with which the individual has, or had, a permanent or immediately prior affiliation. Eligibility for and terms of Visiting Scientist Awards shall be determined in accordance with regulations the Secretary shall prescribe.
