    (3) The organization and operation of animal care committees in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
  (b) Animal care committees; establishment; membership; functions
    (1) Guidelines of the Secretary under subsection (a)(3) of this section shall require animal care committees at each entity which conducts biomedical and behavioral research with funds provided under this chapter (including the National Institutes of Health and the national research institutes) to assure compliance with the guidelines established under subsection (a) of this section.
    (2) Each animal care committee shall be appointed by the chief executive officer of the entity for which the committee is established, shall be composed of not fewer than three members, and shall include at least one individual who has no association with such entity and at least one doctor of veterinary medicine.
    (3) Each animal care committee of a research entity shall–
      (A) review the care and treatment of animals in all animal study areas and facilities of the research entity at least semi-annually to evaluate compliance with applicable guidelines established under subsection (a) of this section for appropriate animal care and treatment;
      (B) keep appropriate records of reviews conducted under subparagraph (A); and
      (C) for each review conducted under subparagraph (A), file with the Director of NIH at least annually (i) a certification that the review has been conducted, and (ii) reports of any violations of guidelines established under subsection (a) of this section or assurances required under paragraph (1) which were observed in such review and which have continued after notice by the committee to the research entity involved of the violations.

  (c) Assurances required in application or contract proposal; reasons for use of animals; notice and comment requirements for promulgation of regulations
     The Director of NIH shall require each applicant for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement involving research on animals which is administered by the National Institutes of Health or any national research institute to include in its application or contract proposal, submitted after the expiration of the twelve-month period beginning on November 20, 1985–
    (1) assurances satisfactory to the Director of NIH that–
      (A) the applicant meets the requirements of the guidelines established under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section and has an animal care committee which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section; and
      (B) scientists, animal technicians, and other personnel involved with animal care, treatment, and use by the applicant have available to them instruction or training in the humane practice of animal maintenance and experimentation, and the concept, availability, and use of research or testing methods that limit the use of animals or limit animal distress; and
    (2) a statement of the reasons for the use of animals in the research to be conducted with funds provided under such grant or contract.
       Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of section 553 of title 5, regulations under this subsection shall be promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment requirements of such section.
  (d) Failure to meet guidelines; suspension or revocation of grant or contract
