    (1) undertake an inventory and assessment of hydrogen technologies and their commercial capability to economically produce, store, or utilize hydrogen in aerospace, transportation, electric utilities, petrochemical, chemical, merchant hydrogen, and other industrial sectors; and
    (2) develop a National Aeronautics Space Administration, Department of Energy, and industry information exchange program to improve technology transfer for–
      (A) application of aerospace experience by industry;
      (B) application of research progress by industry and aerospace;
      (C) application of commercial capability of industry by aerospace; and
      (D) expression of industrial needs to research organizations.
         The information exchange program may consist of workshops, publications, conferences, and a data base for the use by the public and private sectors. The Secretary shall also foster the exchange of generic, nonproprietary information and technology, developed pursuant to this chapter, among industry, academia, and the Federal Government, to help the United States economy attain the economic benefits of this information and technology.
