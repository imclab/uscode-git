The Commission shall determine such compensation. If the compensation so determined is unsatisfactory to the person entitled thereto, such person shall be paid 75 per centum of the amount so determined, and shall be entitled to sue the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims or in any district court of the United States for the district in which such claimant is a resident in a manner provided by section 1346 of title 28 to recover such further sum as added to such 75 per centum will constitute just compensation.
