  (a) In general
    (1) The Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section applicable to all covered products of each of the types specified in paragraphs (1), (2), (4), (6), and (8) through (12) of section 6292(a) of this title, except to the extent that, with respect to any such type (or class thereof), the Commission determines under the second sentence of subsection (b)(5) of this section that labeling in accordance with this section is not technologically or economically feasible.
    (2)      (A) The Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section applicable to all covered products of each of the types specified in paragraphs (3), (5), and (7) of section 6292(a) of this title, except to the extent that with respect to any such type (or class thereof), the Commission determines under the second sentence of subsection (b)(5) of this section that labeling in accordance with this section is not technologically or economically feasible or is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.
      (B) The Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section applicable to the covered product specified in paragraph (13) of section 6292(a) of this title and to which standards are applicable under section 6295 of this title. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any fluorescent lamp ballast manufactured on or after January 1, 1990, will indicate conspicuously, in a manner prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section by July 1, 1989, a capital letter ””E““ printed within a circle on the ballast and on the packaging of the ballast or of the luminaire into which the ballast has been incorporated.
      (C)        (i) Not later than 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section applicable to general service fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, and general service incandescent lamps. Except as provided in clause (ii), such rules shall provide that the labeling of any general service fluorescent lamp, medium base compact fluorescent lamp, and general service incandescent lamp manufactured after the 12-month period beginning on the date of the publication of such rule shall indicate conspicuously on the packaging of the lamp, in a manner prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, such information as the Commission deems necessary to enable consumers to select the most energy efficient lamps which meet their requirements. Labeling information for incandescent lamps shall be based on performance when operated at 120 volts input, regardless of the rated lamp voltage.
        (ii) If the Secretary determines that compliance with the standards specified in section 6295(j) of this title for any lamp will result in the discontinuance of the manufacture of such lamp, the Commission may exempt such lamp from the labeling rules prescribed under clause (i).
      (D)        (i) Not later than one year after October 24, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section for showerheads and faucets to which standards are applicable under subsection (j) of section 6295 of this title. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any showerhead or faucet manufactured after the 12-month period beginning on the date of the publication of such rule shall be consistent with the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.18.1M–1989, except that each showerhead and flow restricting or controlling spout-end device shall bear a permanent legible marking indicating the flow rate, expressed in gallons per minute (gpm) or gallons per cycle (gpc), and the flow rate value shall be the actual flow rate or the maximum flow rate specified by the standards established in subsection (j) of section 6295 of this title.
        (ii) If the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.18.1M–1989 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Commission shall amend the labeling rules established pursuant to clause (i) to be consistent with such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless such requirements are inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or the requirement specified in clause (i) requiring each showerhead and flow restricting or controlling spout-end device to bear a permanent legible marking indicating the flow rate of such product.
      (E)        (i) Not later than one year after October 24, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules under this section for water closets and urinals to which standards are applicable under subsection (k) of section 6295 of this title. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any water closet or urinal manufactured after the 12-month period beginning on the date of the publication of such rule shall be consistent with the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.19.2M–1990, except that each fixture (and flushometer valve associated with such fixture) shall bear a permanent legible marking indicating the water use, expressed in gallons per flush (gpf), and the water use value shall be the actual water use or the maximum water use specified by the standards established in subsection (k) of section 6295 of this title.
        (ii) If the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.19.2M–1990 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Commission shall amend the labeling rules established pursuant to clause (i) to be consistent with such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless such requirements are inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or the requirement specified in clause (i) requiring each fixture and flushometer valve to bear a permanent legible marking indicating the water use of such fixture or flushometer valve.
        (iii) Any labeling rules prescribed under this subparagraph before January 1, 1997, shall provide that, with respect to any gravity tank-type white 2-piece toilet which has a water use greater than 1.6 gallons per flush (gpf), any printed matter distributed or displayed in connection with such product (including packaging and point of sale material, catalog material, and print advertising) shall include, in a conspicuous manner, the words ””For Commercial Use Only““.
    (3) The Commission may prescribe a labeling rule under this section applicable to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title (or a class thereof) if–
      (A) the Commission or the Secretary has made a determination with respect to such type (or class thereof) that labeling in accordance with this section will assist purchasers in making purchasing decisions,
      (B) the Secretary has prescribed test procedures under section 6293(b)(1)(B) of this title for such type (or class thereof), and
      (C) the Commission determines with respect to such type (or class thereof) that application of labeling rules under this section to such type (or class thereof) is economically and technologically feasible.
    (4) Any determination under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.
  (b) Rules in effect; new rules
    (1)      (A) Any labeling rule in effect on March 17, 1987, shall remain in effect until amended, by rule, by the Commission.
      (B) After March 17, 1987, and not later than 30 days after the date on which a proposed test procedure applicable to a covered product of any of the types specified in paragraphs (1) through (13), and paragraphs (15) through (19) of section 6292(a) of this title (or class thereof) is prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title, the Commission shall publish a proposed labeling rule applicable to such type (or class thereof).
    (2) The Commission shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present written or oral data, views, and comments with respect to the proposed labeling rules published under paragraph (1). The period for such presentations shall not be less than 45 days.
    (3) Not earlier than 45 days nor later than 60 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of any type (or class thereof) specified in paragraphs (1) through (12) of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof). Not earlier than 45 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission may prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof).
    (4) A labeling rule prescribed under paragraph (3) shall take effect not later than 3 months after the date of prescription of such rule, except that such rules may take effect not later than 6 months after such date of prescription if the Commission determines that such extension is necessary to allow persons subject to such rules adequate time to come into compliance with such rules.
    (5) The Commission may delay the publication of a proposed labeling rule, or the prescription of a labeling rule, beyond the dates specified in paragraph (1) or (3), if it determines that it cannot publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules which meet the requirements of this section on or prior to the date specified in the applicable paragraph and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. In any such case, it shall publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules for covered products of such type (or class thereof) as soon as practicable unless it determines (A) that labeling in accordance with this section is not economically or technically feasible, or (B) in the case of a type specified in paragraphs (3), (5), and (7) of section 6292(a) of this title, that labeling in accordance with this section is not likely to assist consumers in purchasing decisions. Any such determination shall be published in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. This paragraph shall not apply to the prescription of a labeling rule with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title.
  (c) Content of label
    (1) Subject to paragraph (6), a rule prescribed under this section shall require that each covered product in the type or class of covered products to which the rule applies bear a label which discloses–
      (A) the estimated annual operating cost of such product (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title), except that if–
        (i) the Secretary determines that disclosure of estimated annual operating cost is not technologically feasible, or
        (ii) the Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or is not economically feasible,
       the Commission shall require disclosure of a different useful measure of energy consumption (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title); and
      (B) information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs for covered products to which the rule applies; except that if the Commission requires disclosure under subparagraph (A) of a measure of energy consumption different from estimated annual operating cost, then the label shall disclose the range of such measure of energy consumption of covered products to which such rule applies.
    (2) A rule under this section shall include the following:
      (A) A description of the type or class of covered products to which such rule applies.
      (B) Subject to paragraph (6), information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs or other useful measure of energy consumption (determined in such manner as the rule may prescribe) for such type or class of covered products.
      (C) A description of the test procedures under section 6293 of this title used in determining the estimated annual operating costs or other measure of energy consumption of the type or class of covered products.
      (D) A prototype label and directions for displaying such label.
    (3) A rule under this section shall require that the label be displayed in a manner that the Commission determines is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and is appropriate to carry out this part. The Commission may permit a tag to be used in lieu of a label in any case in which the Commission finds that a tag will carry out the purposes for which the label was intended.
    (4) A rule under this section applicable to a covered product may require disclosure, in any printed matter displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such product, of any information which may be required under this section to be disclosed on the label of such product. Requirements under this paragraph shall not apply to any broadcast advertisement or any advertisement in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.
    (5) The Commission may require that a manufacturer of a covered product to which a rule under this section applies–
      (A) include on the label,
      (B) separately attach to the product, or
      (C) ship with the product,
         additional information relating to energy consumption, including instructions for the maintenance, use, or repair of the covered product, if the Commission determines that such additional information would assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or in using such product, and that such requirement would not be unduly burdensome to manufacturers.
    (6) The Commission may delay the effective date of the requirement specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection applicable to a type or class of covered product, insofar as it requires the disclosure on the label of information respecting range of a measure of energy consumption, for not more than 12 months after the date on which the rule under this section is first applicable to such type or class, if the Commission determines that such information will not be available within an adequate period of time before such date.
    (7) Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection shall not apply to the covered product specified in paragraphs (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), and (18) of section 6292(a) of this title.
    (8) If a manufacturer of a covered product specified in paragraph (15) or (17) of section 6292(a) of this title elects to provide a label for such covered product conveying the estimated annual operating cost of such product or the range of estimated annual operating costs for the type or class of such product–
      (A) such estimated cost or range of costs shall be determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title;
      (B) the format of such label shall be in accordance with a format prescribed by the Commission; and
      (C) such label shall be displayed in a manner, prescribed by the Commission, to be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
  (d) Effective date
     A rule under this section (or an amendment thereto) shall not apply to any covered product the manufacture of which was completed prior to the effective date of such rule or amendment, as the case may be.
  (e) Study of certain products
     The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, shall study consumer products for which labeling rules under this section have not been proposed, in order to determine (1) the aggregate energy consumption of such products, and (2) whether the imposition of labeling requirements under this section would be feasible and useful to consumers in making purchasing decisions. The Secretary shall include the results of such study in the annual report under section 6308 of this title.
  (f) Consultation
     The Secretary and the Commission shall consult with each other on a continuing basis as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their respective responsibilities under this part. Before the Commission makes any determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, it shall obtain the views of the Secretary and shall take such views into account in making such determination.
  (g) Other authority of the Commission
     Until such time as labeling rules under this section take effect with respect to a type or class of covered product, this section shall not affect any authority of the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] to require labeling with respect to energy consumption of such type or class of covered product.
