The Department may not market enriched uranium (including low-enriched uranium derived from highly enriched uranium), or uranium enrichment and related services, after the transition date.
  (b) Transfer of contracts
    (1) In general
       Except as provided in paragraph (2), all contracts, agreements, and leases with the Department, including all uranium enrichment contracts and power purchase contracts, that have been executed by the Department before the transition date and that relate to uranium enrichment and related services shall transfer to the Corporation.
    (2) Exceptions
      (A) TVA settlement
         The rights and responsibilities of the Department under the settlement agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority, filed on December 18, 1987, with the United States Court of Federal Claims, shall not transfer to the Corporation.
      (B) Nontransferable power contracts
         If the Secretary determines that a power purchase contract executed by the Department prior to the transition date cannot be transferred under its terms, the Secretary may continue to receive power under the contract and resell such power to the Corporation at cost.
      (C) Nonpower applications
         Contracts for enriched uranium and uranium services in existence as of October 24, 1992, for research and development or other nonpower applications shall remain with the Department. At the request of the Department, the Corporation, in consultation with the Department, may enter into such contracts it determines to be appropriate.
