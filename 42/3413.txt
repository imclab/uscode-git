   The court shall immediately advise any patient appearing before it pursuant to an order issued under subsection (c) of section 3412 of his right to have (1) counsel at every stage of the judicial proceedings under this subchapter and that, if he is unable because of financial reasons to obtain counsel, the court will, at the patient“s request, assign counsel to represent him; and (2) present for consultation during any examination conducted under this section, a qualified physician retained by such patient, but in no event shall such physician be entitled to participate in any such examination or in the making of any report required under this section with respect to such examination. The court shall also advise such patient that if, after an examination and hearing as provided in this subchapter, he is found to be a narcotic addict who is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, he will be civilly committed to the Surgeon General for treatment; that he may not voluntarily withdraw from such treatment; that the treatment (including posthospitalization treatment and supervision) may last forty-two months; that during treatment he will be confined in an institution; that for a period of three years following his release from confinement he will be under the care and custody of the Surgeon General for treatment and supervision under a posthospitalization program established by the Surgeon General; and that should he fail or refuse to cooperate in such posthospitalization program or be determined by the Surgeon General to have relapsed to the use of narcotic drugs, he may be recommitted for additional confinement in an institution followed by additional posthospitalization treatment and supervision. After so advising the patient, the court shall appoint two qualified physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist, to examine the patient. For the purpose of the examination, the court may order the patient committed for such reasonable period as it shall determine, not to exceed thirty days, to the custody of the Surgeon General for confinement in a suitable hospital or other facility designated by the court. Each physician appointed by the court shall, within such period so determined by the court, examine the patient and file with the court, a written report with respect to such examination. Each such report shall include a statement of the examining physician“s conclusions as to whether the patient examined is a narcotic addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment. Upon the filing of such reports, the patient so examined shall be returned to the court for such further proceedings as it may direct under this subchapter. Copies of such reports shall be made available to the patient and his counsel.
