    (6)      (A) If ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1, as in effect on October 24, 1992, is amended with respect to any small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, or unfired hot water storage tanks, the Secretary shall establish an amended uniform national standard for that product at the minimum level for each effective date specified in the amended ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1, unless the Secretary determines, by rule published in the Federal Register and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that adoption of a uniform national standard more stringent than such amended ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 for such product would result in significant additional conservation of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified.
      (B)        (i) If the Secretary issues a rule containing such a determination, the rule shall establish such amended standard. In determining whether a standard is economically justified for the purposes of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering–
          (I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;
          (II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;
          (III) the total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;
          (IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;
          (V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;
          (VI) the need for national energy conservation; and
          (VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.
        (ii) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard under this paragraph which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product. The Secretary may not prescribe an amended standard under this subparagraph if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that a standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary“s finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary“s determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types or classes.
      (C) A standard amended by the Secretary under this paragraph shall become effective for products manufactured–
        (i) with respect to small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks, on or after a date which is two years after the effective date of the applicable minimum energy efficiency requirement in the amended ASHRAE/IES standard referred to in subparagraph (A); and
        (ii) with respect to large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, on or after a date which is three years after the effective date of the applicable minimum energy efficiency requirement in the amended ASHRAE/IES standard referred to in subparagraph (A);
           except that an energy conservation standard amended by the Secretary pursuant to a rule under subparagraph (B) shall become effective for products manufactured on or after a date which is four years after the date such rule is published in the Federal Register.
  (b) Electric motors
    (1) Except for definite purpose motors, special purpose motors, and those motors exempted by the Secretary under paragraph (2), each electric motor manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) after the 60-month period beginning on October 24, 1992, or in the case of an electric motor which requires listing or certification by a nationally recognized safety testing laboratory, after the 84-month period beginning on October 24, 1992, shall have a nominal full load efficiency of not less than the following:

    (2)      (A) The Secretary may, by rule, provide that the standards specified in paragraph (1) shall not apply to certain types or classes of electric motors if–
        (i) compliance with such standards would not result in significant energy savings because such motors cannot be used in most general purpose applications or are very unlikely to be used in most general purpose applications; and
        (ii) standards for such motors would not be technologically feasible or economically justified.
      (B) Not later than one year after October 24, 1992, a manufacturer seeking an exemption under this paragraph with respect to a type or class of electric motor developed on or before October 24, 1992, shall submit a petition to the Secretary requesting such exemption. Such petition shall include evidence that the type or class of motor meets the criteria for exemption specified in subparagraph (A).
      (C) Not later than two years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall rule on each petition for exemption submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B). In making such ruling, the Secretary shall afford an opportunity for public comment.
      (D) Manufacturers of types or classes of motors developed after October 24, 1992, to which standards under paragraph (1) would be applicable may petition the Secretary for exemptions from compliance with such standards based on the criteria specified in subparagraph (A).
    (3)      (A) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than the end of the 24-month period beginning on the effective date of the standards established under paragraph (1) to determine if such standards should be amended. Such rule shall provide that any amendment shall apply to electric motors manufactured on or after a date which is five years after the effective date of the standards established under paragraph (1).
      (B) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than 24 months after the effective date of the previous final rule to determine whether to amend the standards in effect for such product. Any such amendment shall apply to electric motors manufactured after a date which is five years after–
        (i) the effective date of the previous amendment; or
        (ii) if the previous final rule did not amend the standards, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been effective.
