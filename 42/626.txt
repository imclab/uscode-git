  (a) Authorization of appropriations
     There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such sums as the Congress may determine–
    (1) for grants by the Secretary–
      (A) to public or other nonprofit institutions of higher learning, and to public or other nonprofit agencies and organizations engaged in research or child-welfare activities, for special research or demonstration projects in the field of child welfare which are of regional or national significance and for special projects for the demonstration of new methods or facilities which show promise of substantial contribution to the advancement of child welfare;
      (B) to State or local public agencies responsible for administering, or supervising the administration of, the plan under this part, for projects for the demonstration of the utilization of research (including findings resulting therefrom) in the field of child welfare in order to encourage experimental and special types of welfare services; and
      (C) to public or other nonprofit institutions of higher learning for special projects for training personnel for work in the field of child welfare, including traineeships described in section 628a of this title with such stipends and allowances as may be permitted by the Secretary; and
    (2) for contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with States and public and other organizations and agencies for the conduct of research, special projects, or demonstration projects relating to such matters.
  (b) Appropriations for demonstration projects for development of alternate care arrangements for infants not requiring hospitalization
    (1) There are authorized to be appropriated $4,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990 for grants by the Secretary to public or private nonprofit entities submitting applications under this subsection for the purpose of conducting demonstration projects under this subsection to develop alternative care arrangements for infants who do not have health conditions that require hospitalization and who would otherwise remain in inappropriate hospital settings.
    (2) The demonstration projects conducted under this section may include–
      (A) multidisciplinary projects designed to prevent the inappropriate hospitalization of infants and to allow infants described in paragraph (1) to remain with or return to a parent in a residential setting, where appropriate care for the infant and suitable treatment for the parent (including treatment for drug or alcohol addiction) may be assured, with the goal (where possible) of rehabilitating the parent and eliminating the need for such care for the infant;
      (B) multidisciplinary projects that assure appropriate, individualized care for such infants in a foster home or other non-medical residential setting in cases where such infant does not require hospitalization and would otherwise remain in inappropriate hospital settings, including projects to demonstrate methods to recruit, train, and retain foster care families; and
      (C) such other projects as the Secretary determines will best serve the interests of such infants and will serve as models for projects that agencies or organizations in other communities may wish to develop.
    (3) In the case of any project which includes the use of funds authorized under this subsection for the care of infants in foster homes or other non-medical residential settings away from their parents, there shall be developed for each such infant a case plan of the type described in section 675(1) of this title (to the extent that such infant is not otherwise covered by such a plan), and each such project shall include a case review system of the type described in section 675(5) of this title (covering each such infant who is not otherwise subject to such a system).
    (4) In evaluating applications from entities proposing to conduct demonstration projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to those projects that serve areas most in need of alternative care arrangements for infants described in paragraph (1).
    (5) No project may be funded unless the application therefor contains assurances that it will–
      (A) provide for adequate evaluation;
      (B) provide for coordination with local governments;
      (C) provide for community education regarding the inappropriate hospitalization of infants;
      (D) use, to the extent practical, other available private, local, State, and Federal sources for the provision of direct services; and
      (E) meet such other criteria as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (6) Grants may be used to pay the costs of maintenance and of necessary medical and social services (to the extent that these costs are not otherwise paid for under other subchapters of this chapter), and for such other purposes as the Secretary may allow.
    (7) The Secretary shall provide training and technical assistance to grantees, as requested.
  (c) Payments; advances or reimbursements; installments; conditions
     Payments of grants or under contracts or cooperative arrangements under this section may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments, as the Secretary may determine; and shall be made on such conditions as the Secretary finds necessary to carry out the purposes of the grants, contracts, or other arrangements.
