   The Congress finds and declares thatâ€“
  (1) used oil is a valuable source of increasingly scarce energy and materials;
  (2) technology exists to re-refine, reprocess, reclaim, and otherwise recycle used oil;
  (3) used oil constitutes a threat to public health and the environment when reused or disposed of improperly; and
     that, therefore, it is in the national interest to recycle used oil in a manner which does not constitute a threat to public health and the environment and which conserves energy and materials.
