   The NASA Administrator shall annually establish a goal of at least 8 per centum of the total value of prime and subcontracts awarded in support of authorized programs, including the space station by the time operational status is obtained, which funds will be made available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (within the meaning of section 637(a)(5) and (6) of title 15), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority educational institutions (as defined by the Secretary of Education pursuant to the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.)).
   To facilitate progress in reaching this goal, the NASA Administrator shall submit within one year from Nov. 9, 1989, a plan describing the process to be followed to achieve the prescribed level of participation in the shortest practicable time.
