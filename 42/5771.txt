   The Congress hereby finds that–
  (1) each year thousands of children are abducted or removed from the control of a parent having legal custody without such parent“s consent, under circumstances which immediately place them in grave danger;
  (2) many of these children are never reunited with their families;
  (3) often there are no clues to the whereabouts of these children;
  (4) many missing children are at great risk of both physical harm and sexual exploitation;
  (5) in many cases, parents and local law enforcement officials have neither the resources nor the expertise to mount expanded search efforts;
  (6) abducted children are frequently moved from one locality to another, requiring the cooperation and coordination of local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts;
  (7) on frequent occasions, law enforcement authorities quickly exhaust all leads in missing children cases, and require assistance from distant communities where the child may be located; and
  (8) Federal assistance is urgently needed to coordinate and assist in this interstate problem.
