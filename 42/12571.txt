  (d) Five percent limitation on administrative costs
    (1) Limitation

      (A) the recipient of the assistance; and
      (B) national service programs carried out or supported with the assistance.
    (2) Rules on use
       The Corporation may by rule prescribe the manner and extent to which–
      (A) assistance provided under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be used to cover administrative costs; and
      (B) that portion of the assistance available to cover administrative costs should be distributed between–
        (i) the original recipient of the grant or transfer of assistance under such subsection; and
        (ii) national service programs carried out or supported with the assistance.

    (1) Requirements
       Except as provided in section 12594 of this title, the Federal share of the cost of carrying out a national service program that receives the assistance under subsection (a) of this section, whether the assistance is provided directly or as a subgrant from the original recipient of the assistance, may not exceed 75 percent of such cost.
    (2) Calculation
       In providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program–
      (A) shall provide for such share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment, or services; and
      (B) may provide for such share through State sources, local sources, or other Federal sources (other than the use of funds made available under the national service laws).
    (3) Cost of health care
       In providing a payment in cash under paragraph (2)(A) as part of providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program may count not more than 85 percent of the cost of providing a health care policy described in section 12594(d)(2) of this title toward such share.
    (4) Waiver
       The Corporation may waive in whole or in part the requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to a national service program in any fiscal year if the Corporation determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to a lack of available financial resources at the local level.
