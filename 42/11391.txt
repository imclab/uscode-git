  (a) In general
     The Secretary may make grants to applicants to demonstrate the desirability and feasibility of providing very low-cost housing, to be known as safe havens, to homeless persons who, at the time, are unwilling or unable to participate in mental health treatment programs or to receive other supportive services.
  (b) Purposes
     The demonstration program carried out under this part shall demonstrateâ€“
    (1) whether and on what basis eligible persons choose to reside in safe havens;
    (2) the extent to which, after a period of residence in a safe haven, residents are willing to participate in mental health treatment programs, substance abuse treatment, or other treatment programs and to move toward a more traditional form of permanent housing and the availability in the community of such permanent housing and treatment programs;
    (3) whether safe havens are cost-effective in comparison with other alternatives for eligible persons; and
    (4) the various ways in which safe havens may be used to provide accommodations and low-demand services and referrals for eligible persons.
