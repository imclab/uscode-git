     The benefits provided by parts A and B of this subchapter shall include benefits for individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease as provided in section 426–1 of this title, and benefits for kidney donors as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the type, duration, and scope of the benefit provided by parts A and B of this subchapter with respect to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease and who are entitled to such benefits without regard to section 426–1 of this title shall in no case be less than the type, duration, and scope of the benefits so provided for individuals entitled to such benefits solely by reason of that section.
  (b) Payments with respect to services; dialysis; regulations; physicians“ services; target reimbursement rates; home dialysis supplies and equipment; self-care home dialysis support services; self-care dialysis units; hepatitis B vaccine
    (1) Payments under this subchapter with respect to services, in addition to services for which payment would otherwise be made under this subchapter, furnished to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease shall include (A) payments on behalf of such individuals to providers of services and renal dialysis facilities which meet such requirements as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe for institutional dialysis services and supplies (including self-dialysis services in a self-care dialysis unit maintained by the provider or facility), transplantation services, self-care home dialysis support services which are furnished by the provider or facility, and routine professional services performed by a physician during a maintenance dialysis episode if payments for his other professional services furnished to an individual who has end stage renal disease are made on the basis specified in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, (B) payments to or on behalf of such individuals for home dialysis supplies and equipment, and (C) payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for self-administered erythropoietin as described in section 1395x(s)(2)(P) \1\N of this title if the Secretary finds that the patient receiving such drug from such a supplier can safely and effectively administer the drug (in accordance with the applicable methods and standards established by the Secretary pursuant to such section). The requirements prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall include requirements for a minimum utilization rate for transplantations.
    (2)      (A) With respect to payments for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease for which payments may be made under part B of this subchapter, such payments (unless otherwise provided in this section) shall be equal to 80 percent of the amounts determined in accordance with subparagraph (B); and with respect to payments for services for which payments may be made under part A of this subchapter, the amounts of such payments (which amounts shall not exceed, in respect to costs in procuring organs attributable to payments made to an organ procurement agency or histocompatibility laboratory, the costs incurred by that agency or laboratory) shall be determined in accordance with section 1395x(v) of this title or section 1395ww of this title (if applicable). Payments shall be made to a renal dialysis facility only if it agrees to accept such payments as payment in full for covered services, except for payment by the individual of 20 percent of the estimated amounts for such services calculated on the basis established by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) and the deductible amount imposed by section 1395T3lK(b) of this title.
      (B) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations any methods and procedures to (i) determine the costs incurred by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities in furnishing covered services to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, and (ii) determine, on a cost-related basis or other economical and equitable basis (including any basis authorized under section 1395x(v) of this title) and consistent with any regulations promulgated under paragraph (7), the amounts of payments to be made for part B services furnished by such providers and facilities to such individuals.
      (C) Such regulations, in the case of services furnished by proprietary providers and facilities (other than hospital outpatient departments) may include, if the Secretary finds it feasible and appropriate, provision for recognition of a reasonable rate of return on equity capital, providing such rate of return does not exceed the rate of return stipulated in section 1395x(v)(1)(B) of this title.
      (D) For purposes of section 1395T3ooK of this title, a renal dialysis facility shall be treated as a provider of services.
    (3) With respect to payments for physicians“ services furnished to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, the Secretary shall pay 80 percent of the amounts calculated for such services–
      (A) on a reasonable charge basis (but may, in such case, make payment on the basis of the prevailing charges of other physicians for comparable services or, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1992, on the basis described in section 1395w–4 of this title) except that payment may not be made under this subparagraph for routine services furnished during a maintenance dialysis episode, or
      (B) on a comprehensive monthly fee or other basis (which effectively encourages the efficient delivery of dialysis services and provides incentives for the increased use of home dialysis) for an aggregate of services provided over a period of time (as defined in regulations).
    (4)      (A) Pursuant to agreements with approved providers of services and renal dialysis facilities, the Secretary may make payments to such providers and facilities for the cost of home dialysis supplies and equipment and self-care home dialysis support services furnished to patients whose self-care home dialysis is under the direct supervision of such provider or facility, on the basis of a target reimbursement rate (as defined in paragraph (6)) or on the basis of a method established under paragraph (7).
      (B) The Secretary shall make payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment furnished to a patient whose self-care home dialysis is not under the direct supervision of an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility only in accordance with a written agreement under which–
        (i) the patient certifies that the supplier is the sole provider of such supplies and equipment to the patient,
        (ii) the supplier agrees to receive payment for the cost of such supplies and equipment only on an assignment-related basis, and
        (iii) the supplier certifies that it has entered into a written agreement with an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility under which such provider or facility agrees to furnish to such patient all self-care home dialysis support services and all other necessary dialysis services and supplies, including institutional dialysis services and supplies and emergency services.
    (5) An agreement under paragraph (4) shall require, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the provider or facility will–
      (A) assume full responsibility for directly obtaining or arranging for the provision of–
        (i) such medically necessary dialysis equipment as is prescribed by the attending physician;
        (ii) dialysis equipment maintenance and repair services;
        (iii) the purchase and delivery of all necessary medical supplies; and
        (iv) where necessary, the services of trained home dialysis aides;
      (B) perform all such administrative functions and maintain such information and records as the Secretary may require to verify the transactions and arrangements described in subparagraph (A);
      (C) submit such cost reports, data, and information as the Secretary may require with respect to the costs incurred for equipment, supplies, and services furnished to the facility“s home dialysis patient population; and
      (D) provide for full access for the Secretary to all such records, data, and information as he may require to perform his functions under this section.
    (6) The Secretary shall establish, for each calendar year, commencing with January 1, 1979, a target reimbursement rate for home dialysis which shall be adjusted for regional variations in the cost of providing home dialysis. In establishing such a rate, the Secretary shall include–
      (A) the Secretary“s estimate of the cost of providing medically necessary home dialysis supplies and equipment;
      (B) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover the cost of providing personnel to aid in home dialysis; and
      (C) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover administrative costs and to provide an incentive for the efficient delivery of home dialysis;
         but in no event (except as may be provided in regulations under paragraph (7)) shall such target rate exceed 75 percent of the national average payment, adjusted for regional variations, for maintenance dialysis services furnished in approved providers and facilities during the preceding fiscal year. Any such target rate so established shall be utilized, without renegotiation of the rate, throughout the calendar year for which it is established. During the last quarter of each calendar year, the Secretary shall establish a home dialysis target reimbursement rate for the next calendar year based on the most recent data available to the Secretary at the time. In establishing any rate under this paragraph, the Secretary may utilize a competitive-bid procedure, a prenegotiated rate procedure, or any other procedure (including methods established under paragraph (7)) which the Secretary determines is appropriate and feasible in order to carry out this paragraph in an effective and efficient manner.
    (7) The Secretary shall provide by regulation for a method (or methods) for determining prospectively the amounts of payments to be made for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals in a facility and to such individuals at home. Such method (or methods) shall provide for the prospective determination of a rate (or rates) for each mode of care based on a single composite weighted formula (which takes into account the mix of patients who receive dialysis services at a facility or at home and the relative costs of providing such services in such settings) for hospital-based facilities and such a single composite weighted formula for other renal dialysis facilities, or based on such other method or combination of methods which differentiate between hospital-based facilities and other renal dialysis facilities and which the Secretary determines, after detailed analysis, will more effectively encourage the more efficient delivery of dialysis services and will provide greater incentives for increased use of home dialysis than through the single composite weighted formulas. The amount of a payment made under any method other than a method based on a single composite weighted formula may not exceed the amount (or, in the case of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis, 130 percent of the amount) of the median payment that would have been made under the formula for hospital-based facilities. The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions to such methods as may be warranted by unusual circumstances (including the special circumstances of sole facilities located in isolated, rural areas and of pediatric facilities). Each application for such an exception shall be deemed to be approved unless the Secretary disapproves it by not later than 60 working days after the date the application is filed. The Secretary may provide that such method will serve in lieu of any target reimbursement rate that would otherwise be established under paragraph (6). The Secretary shall reduce the amount of each composite rate payment under this paragraph for each treatment by 50 cents (subject to such adjustments as may be required to reflect modes of dialysis other than hemodialysis) and provide for payment of such amount to the organizations (designated under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section) for such organizations“ necessary and proper administrative costs incurred in carrying out the responsibilities described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. The Secretary shall provide that amounts paid under the previous sentence shall be distributed to the organizations described in subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section to ensure equitable treatment of all such network organizations. The Secretary in distributing any such payments to network organizations shall take into account–
      (A) the geographic size of the network area;
      (B) the number of providers of end stage renal disease services in the network area;
      (C) the number of individuals who are entitled to end stage renal disease services in the network area; and
      (D) the proportion of the aggregate administrative funds collected in the network area.
    (8) For purposes of this subchapter, the term ””home dialysis supplies and equipment““ means medically necessary supplies and equipment (including supportive equipment) required by an individual suffering from end stage renal disease in connection with renal dialysis carried out in his home (as defined in regulations), including obtaining, installing, and maintaining such equipment.
    (9) For purposes of this subchapter, the term ””self-care home dialysis support services““, to the extent permitted in regulation, means–
      (A) periodic monitoring of the patient“s home adaptation, including visits by qualified provider or facility personnel (as defined in regulations), so long as this is done in accordance with a plan prepared and periodically reviewed by a professional team (as defined in regulations) including the individual“s physician;
      (B) installation and maintenance of dialysis equipment;
      (C) testing and appropriate treatment of the water; and
      (D) such additional supportive services as the Secretary finds appropriate and desirable.
    (10) For purposes of this subchapter, the term ””self-care dialysis unit““ means a renal dialysis facility or a distinct part of such facility or of a provider of services, which has been approved by the Secretary to make self-dialysis services, as defined by the Secretary in regulations, available to individuals who have been trained for self-dialysis. A self-care dialysis unit must, at a minimum, furnish the services, equipment and supplies needed for self-care dialysis, have patient-staff ratios which are appropriate to self-dialysis (allowing for such appropriate lesser degree of ongoing medical supervision and assistance of ancillary personnel than is required for full care maintenance dialysis), and meet such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to the quality and cost-effectiveness of services.
    (11)      (A) Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as dialysis services for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section. Payment for such vaccine and its administration shall be made separately in accordance with section 1395T3lK of this title.
      (B) Erythropoietin, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as a dialysis service for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section, and payment for such item shall be made separately–
        (i) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a physician, in accordance with section 1395T3lK of this title; and
        (ii) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a provider of services, renal dialysis facility, or other supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment–
          (I) for erythropoietin provided during 1994, in an amount equal to $10 per thousand units (rounded to the nearest 100 units), and
          (II) for erythropoietin provided during a subsequent year, in an amount determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, except that such amount may not exceed the amount determined under this clause for the previous year increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year.
      (C) The amount payable to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for erythropoietin shall be determined in the same manner as the amount payable to a renal dialysis facility for such item.
  (c) Renal disease network areas; coordinating councils, executive committees, and medical review boards; national end stage renal disease medical information system; functions of network organizations
    (1)      (A)        (i) For the purpose of assuring effective and efficient administration of the benefits provided under this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance with such criteria as he finds necessary to assure the performance of the responsibilities and functions specified in paragraph (2)–
          (I) establish at least 17 end stage renal disease network areas, and
          (II) for each such area, designate a network administrative organization which, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, shall establish (aa) a network council of renal dialysis and transplant facilities located in the area and (bb) a medical review board, which has a membership including at least one patient representative and physicians, nurses, and social workers engaged in treatment relating to end stage renal disease.
             The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a description of the geographic area that he determines, after consultation with appropriate professional and patient organizations, constitutes each network area and the criteria on the basis of which such determination is made.
        (ii)          (I) In order to determine whether the Secretary should enter into, continue, or terminate an agreement with a network administrative organization designated for an area established under clause (i), the Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register standards, criteria, and procedures to evaluate an applicant organization“s capabilities to perform (and, in the case of an organization with which such an agreement is in effect, actual performance of) the responsibilities described in paragraph (2). The Secretary shall evaluate each applicant based on quality and scope of services and may not accord more than 20 percent of the weight of the evaluation to the element of price.
          (II) An agreement with a network administrative organization may be terminated by the Secretary only if he finds, after applying such standards and criteria, that the organization has failed to perform its prescribed responsibilities effectively and efficiently. If such an agreement is to be terminated, the Secretary shall select a successor to the agreement on the basis of competitive bidding and in a manner that provides an orderly transition.
      (B) At least one patient representative shall serve as a member of each network council and each medical review board.
      (C) The Secretary shall, in regulations, prescribe requirements with respect to membership in network organizations by individuals (and the relatives of such individuals) (i) who have an ownership or control interest in a facility or provider which furnishes services referred to in section 1395x(s)(2)(F) of this title, or (ii) who have received remuneration from any such facility or provider in excess of such amounts as constitute reasonable compensation for services (including time and effort relative to the provision of professional medical services) or goods supplied to such facility or provider; and such requirements shall provide for the definition, disclosure, and, to the maximum extent consistent with effective administration, prevention of potential or actual financial or professional conflicts of interest with respect to decisions concerning the appropriateness, nature, or site of patient care.
    (2) The network organizations of each network shall be responsible, in addition to such other duties and functions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, for–
      (A) encouraging, consistent with sound medical practice, the use of those treatment settings most compatible with the successful rehabilitation of the patient and the participation of patients, providers of services, and renal disease facilities in vocational rehabilitation programs;
      (B) developing criteria and standards relating to the quality and appropriateness of patient care and with respect to working with patients, facilities, and providers in encouraging participation in vocational rehabilitation programs; and network goals with respect to the placement of patients in self-care settings and undergoing or preparing for transplantation;
      (C) evaluating the procedure by which facilities and providers in the network assess the appropriateness of patients for proposed treatment modalities;
      (D) implementing a procedure for evaluating and resolving patient grievances;
      (E) conducting on-site reviews of facilities and providers as necessary (as determined by a medical review board or the Secretary), utilizing standards of care established by the network organization to assure proper medical care;
      (F) collecting, validating, and analyzing such data as are necessary to prepare the reports required by subparagraph (H) and to assure the maintenance of the registry established under paragraph (7);
      (G) identifying facilities and providers that are not cooperating toward meeting network goals and assisting such facilities and providers in developing appropriate plans for correction and reporting to the Secretary on facilities and providers that are not providing appropriate medical care; and
      (H) submitting an annual report to the Secretary on July 1 of each year which shall include a full statement of the network“s goals, data on the network“s performance in meeting its goals (including data on the comparative performance of facilities and providers with respect to the identification and placement of suitable candidates in self-care settings and transplantation and encouraging participation in vocational rehabilitation programs), identification of those facilities that have consistently failed to cooperate with network goals, and recommendations with respect to the need for additional or alternative services or facilities in the network in order to meet the network goals, including self-dialysis training, transplantation, and organ procurement facilities.
    (3) Where the Secretary determines, on the basis of the data contained in the network“s annual report and such other relevant data as may be available to him, that a facility or provider has consistently failed to cooperate with network plans and goals or to follow the recommendations of the medical review board, he may terminate or withhold certification of such facility or provider (for purposes of payment for services furnished to individuals with end stage renal disease) until he determines that such provider or facility is making reasonable and appropriate efforts to cooperate with the network“s plans and goals. If the Secretary determines that the facility“s or provider“s failure to cooperate with network plans and goals does not jeopardize patient health or safety or justify termination of certification, he may instead, after reasonable notice to the provider or facility and to the public, impose such other sanctions as he determines to be appropriate, which sanctions may include denial of reimbursement with respect to some or all patients admitted to the facility after the date of notice to the facility or provider, and graduated reduction in reimbursement for all patients.
    (4) The Secretary shall, in determining whether to certify additional facilities or expansion of existing facilities within a network, take into account the network“s goals and performance as reflected in the network“s annual report.
    (5) The Secretary, after consultation with appropriate professional and planning organizations, shall provide such guidelines with respect to the planning and delivery of renal disease services as are necessary to assist network organizations in their development of their respective networks“ goals to promote the optimum use of self-dialysis and transplantation by suitable candidates for such modalities.
    (6) It is the intent of the Congress that the maximum practical number of patients who are medically, socially, and psychologically suitable candidates for home dialysis or transplantation should be so treated and that the maximum practical number of patients who are suitable candidates for vocational rehabilitation services be given access to such services and encouraged to return to gainful employment. The Secretary shall consult with appropriate professional and network organizations and consider available evidence relating to developments in research, treatment methods, and technology for home dialysis and transplantation.
    (7) The Secretary shall establish a national end stage renal disease registry the purpose of which shall be to assemble and analyze the data reported by network organizations, transplant centers, and other sources on all end stage renal disease patients in a manner that will permit–
      (A) the preparation of the annual report to the Congress required under subsection (g) of this section;
      (B) an identification of the economic impact, cost-effectiveness, and medical efficacy of alternative modalities of treatment;
      (C) an evaluation with respect to the most appropriate allocation of resources for the treatment and research into the cause of end stage renal disease;
      (D) the determination of patient mortality and morbidity rates, and trends in such rates, and other indices of quality of care; and
      (E) such other analyses relating to the treatment and management of end stage renal disease as will assist the Congress in evaluating the end stage renal disease program under this section.
         The Secretary shall provide for such coordination of data collection activities, and such consolidation of existing end stage renal disease data systems, as is necessary to achieve the purpose of such registry, shall determine the appropriate location of the registry, and shall provide for the appointment of a professional advisory group to assist the Secretary in the formulation of policies and procedures relevant to the management of such registry.
    (8) The provisions of sections 1320c–6 and 1320c–9 of this title shall apply with respect to network administrative organizations (including such organizations as medical review boards) with which the Secretary has entered into agreements under this subsection.
  (d) Donors of kidney for transplant surgery
     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in section 426 of this title any individual who donates a kidney for transplant surgery shall be entitled to benefits under parts A and B of this subchapter with respect to such donation. Reimbursement for the reasonable expenses incurred by such an individual with respect to a kidney donation shall be made (without regard to the deductible, premium, and coinsurance provisions of this subchapter), in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations, for all reasonable preparatory, operation, and postoperation recovery expenses associated with such donation, including but not limited to the expenses for which payment could be made if he were an eligible individual for purposes of parts A and B of this subchapter without regard to this subsection. Payments for postoperation recovery expenses shall be limited to the actual period of recovery.
  (e) Reimbursement of providers, facilities, and nonprofit entities for costs of artificial kidney and automated dialysis peritoneal machines for home dialysis
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may, pursuant to agreements with approved providers of services, renal dialysis facilities, and nonprofit entities which the Secretary finds can furnish equipment economically and efficiently, reimburse such providers, facilities, and nonprofit entities (without regard to the deductible and coinsurance provisions of this subchapter) for the reasonable cost of the purchase, installation, maintenance and reconditioning for subsequent use of artificial kidney and automated dialysis peritoneal machines (including supportive equipment) which are to be used exclusively by entitled individuals dialyzing at home.
    (2) An agreement under this subsection shall require that the provider, facility, or other entity will–
      (A) make the equipment available for use only by entitled individuals dialyzing at home;
      (B) recondition the equipment, as needed, for reuse by such individuals throughout the useful life of the equipment, including modification of the equipment consistent with advances in research and technology;
      (C) provide for full access for the Secretary to all records and information relating to the purchase, maintenance, and use of the equipment; and
      (D) submit such reports, data, and information as the Secretary may require with respect to the cost, management, and use of the equipment.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the term ””supportive equipment““ includes blood pumps, heparin pumps, bubble detectors, other alarm systems, and such other items as the Secretary may determine are medically necessary.
  (f) Experiments, studies, and pilot projects
    (1) The Secretary shall initiate and carry out, at selected locations in the United States, pilot projects under which financial assistance in the purchase of new or used durable medical equipment for renal dialysis is provided to individuals suffering from end stage renal disease at the time home dialysis is begun, with provision for a trial period to assure successful adaptation to home dialysis before the actual purchase of such equipment.
    (2) The Secretary shall conduct experiments to evaluate methods for reducing the costs of the end stage renal disease program. Such experiments shall include (without being limited to) reimbursement for nurses and dialysis technicians to assist with home dialysis, and reimbursement to family members assisting with home dialysis.
    (3) The Secretary shall conduct experiments to evaluate methods of dietary control for reducing the costs of the end stage renal disease program, including (without being limited to) the use of protein-controlled products to delay the necessity for, or reduce the frequency of, dialysis in the treatment of end stage renal disease.
    (4) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive study of methods for increasing public participation in kidney donation and other organ donation programs.
    (5) The Secretary shall conduct a full and complete study of the reimbursement of physicians for services furnished to patients with end stage renal disease under this subchapter, giving particular attention to the range of payments to physicians for such services, the average amounts of such payments, and the number of hours devoted to furnishing such services to patients at home, in renal disease facilities, in hospitals, and elsewhere.
    (6) The Secretary shall conduct a study of the number of patients with end stage renal disease who are not eligible for benefits with respect to such disease under this subchapter (by reason of this section or otherwise), and of the economic impact of such noneligibility of such individuals. Such study shall include consideration of mechanisms whereby governmental and other health plans might be instituted or modified to permit the purchase of actuarially sound coverage for the costs of end stage renal disease.
    (7)      (A) The Secretary shall establish protocols on standards and conditions for the reuse of dialyzer filters for those facilities and providers which voluntarily elect to reuse such filters.
      (B) With respect to dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 1988 (or July 1, 1988, with respect to protocols that relate to the reuse of bloodlines), no dialysis facility may reuse dialysis supplies (other than dialyzer filters) unless the Secretary has established a protocol with respect to the reuse of such supplies and the facility follows the protocol so established.
      (C) The Secretary shall incorporate protocols established under this paragraph, and the requirement of subparagraph (B), into the requirements for facilities prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section and failure to follow such a protocol or requirement subjects such a facility to denial of participation in the program established under this section and to denial of payment for dialysis treatment not furnished in compliance with such a protocol or in violation of such requirement.
    (8) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress no later than October 1, 1979, a full report on the experiments conducted under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (7), and the studies under paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7). Such report shall include any recommendations for legislative changes which the Secretary finds necessary or desirable as a result of such experiments and studies.
  (g) Conditional approval of dialysis facilities; restriction-of-payments notice to public and facility; notice and hearing; judicial review
    (1) In any case where the Secretary–
      (A) finds that a renal dialysis facility is not in substantial compliance with requirements for such facilities prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section,
      (B) finds that the facility“s deficiencies do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of patients, and
      (C) has given the facility a reasonable opportunity to correct its deficiencies,
         the Secretary may, in lieu of terminating approval of the facility, determine that payment under this subchapter shall be made to the facility only for services furnished to individuals who were patients of the facility before the effective date of the notice.
    (2) The Secretary“s decision to restrict payments under this subsection shall be made effective only after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be prescribed in regulations, and shall remain in effect until (A) the Secretary finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with the requirements under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, or (B) the Secretary terminates the agreement under this subchapter with the facility.
    (3) A facility dissatisfied with a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Secretary (after reasonable notice) to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the Secretary“s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title, except that, in so applying such sections and in applying section 405(T3lK) of this title thereto, any reference therein to the Commissioner of Social Security or the Social Security Administration shall be considered a reference to the Secretary or the Department of Health and Human Services, respectively.
