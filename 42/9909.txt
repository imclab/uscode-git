  (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, grants made under this chapter (other than amounts made available under section 9910(d) of this title) may not be used by the State, or by any other person with which the State makes arrangements to carry out the purposes of this chapter for the purchase or improvement of land, or the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement (other than low-cost residential weatherization or other energy-related home repairs) of any building or other facility.
  (b) The Secretary may waive the limitation contained in subsection (a) of this section upon the State“s request for such a waiver if he finds that the request describes extraordinary circumstances to justify the purchase of land or the construction of facilities (or the making of permanent improvements) and that permitting the waiver will contribute to the State“s ability to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
