   The Congress finds thatâ€“
  (1) the Federal Government has a duty to provide public and other federally assisted low-income housing that is decent, safe, and free from illegal drugs;
  (2) public and other federally assisted low-income housing in many areas suffers from rampant drug-related crime;
  (3) drug dealers are increasingly imposing a reign of terror on public and other federally assisted low-income housing tenants;
  (4) the increase in drug-related crime not only leads to murders, muggings, and other forms of violence against tenants, but also to a deterioration of the physical environment that requires substantial government expenditures; and
  (5) local law enforcement authorities often lack the resources to deal with the drug problem in public and other federally assisted low-income housing, particularly in light of the recent reductions in Federal aid to cities.
