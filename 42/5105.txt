  (a) Research
    (1) Topics
       The Secretary shall, in consultation with other Federal agencies and recognized experts in the field, carry out a continuing interdisciplinary program of research that is designed to provide information needed to better protect children from abuse or neglect and to improve the well-being of abused or neglected children, with at least a portion of such research being field initiated. Such research program may focus on–
      (A) the nature and scope of child abuse and neglect;
      (B) causes, prevention, assessment, identification, treatment, cultural and socio-economic distinctions, and the consequences of child abuse and neglect;
      (C) appropriate, effective and culturally sensitive investigative, administrative, and judicial procedures with respect to cases of child abuse; and
      (D) the national incidence of child abuse and neglect, including–
        (i) the extent to which incidents of child abuse are increasing or decreasing in number and severity;
        (ii) the incidence of substantiated and unsubstantiated reported child abuse cases;
        (iii) the number of substantiated cases that result in a judicial finding of child abuse or neglect or related criminal court convictions;
        (iv) the extent to which the number of unsubstantiated, unfounded and false reported cases of child abuse or neglect have contributed to the inability of a State to respond effectively to serious cases of child abuse or neglect;
        (v) the extent to which the lack of adequate resources and the lack of adequate training of individuals required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse have contributed to the inability of a State to respond effectively to serious cases of child abuse and neglect;
        (vi) the number of unsubstantiated, false, or unfounded reports that have resulted in a child being placed in substitute care, and the duration of such placement;
        (vii) the extent to which unsubstantiated reports return as more serious cases of child abuse or neglect;
        (viii) the incidence and prevalence of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and physical and emotional neglect in substitute care; and
        (ix) the incidence and outcomes of abuse allegations reported within the context of divorce, custody, or other family court proceedings, and the interaction between this venue and the child protective services system.
    (2) Priorities

      (B) In establishing research priorities as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall–
        (i) publish proposed priorities in the Federal Register for public comment; and
        (ii) allow not less than 60 days for public comment on such proposed priorities.
  (b) Provision of technical assistance
    (1) In general
       The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to State and local public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations, including disability organizations and persons who work with children with disabilities, to assist such agencies and organizations in planning, improving, developing, and carrying out programs and activities relating to the prevention, assessment, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect.

       In making grants for purposes of conducting research under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give special consideration to applications for long-term projects.
  (d) Peer review for grants
    (1) Establishment of peer review process
      (A) The Secretary shall, in consultation with experts in the field and other federal \1\N agencies, establish a formal, rigorous, and meritorious peer review process for purposes of evaluating and reviewing applications for grants under this section and determining the relative merits of the projects for which such assistance is requested. The purpose of this process is to enhance the quality and usefulness of research in the field of child abuse and neglect.
      (B) In establishing the process required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall appoint to the peer review panels only members who are experts in the field of child abuse and neglect or related disciplines, with appropriate expertise in the application to be reviewed, and who are not individuals who are officers or employees of the Administration on Children and Families. The panels shall meet as often as is necessary to facilitate the expeditious review of applications for grants and contracts under this section, but may not meet less than once a year. The Secretary shall ensure that the peer review panel utilizes scientifically valid review criteria and scoring guidelines for review committees.
    (2) Review of applications for assistance
       Each peer review panel established under paragraph (1)(A) that reviews any application for a grant shall–
      (A) determine and evaluate the merit of each project described in such application;
      (B) rank such application with respect to all other applications it reviews in the same priority area for the fiscal year involved, according to the relative merit of all of the projects that are described in such application and for which financial assistance is requested; and
      (C) make recommendations to the Secretary concerning whether the application for the project shall be approved.
       The Secretary shall award grants under this section on the basis of competitive review.
    (3) Notice of approval
      (A) The Secretary shall provide grants and contracts under this section from among the projects which the peer review panels established under paragraph (1)(A) have determined to have merit.
      (B) In the instance in which the Secretary approves an application for a program without having approved all applications ranked above such application (as determined under paragraph (2)(B)), the Secretary shall append to the approved application a detailed explanation of the reasons relied on for approving the application and for failing to approve each pending application that is superior in merit, as indicated on the list under paragraph (2)(B).
