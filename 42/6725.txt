  (3) an assurance that reasonable reports will be furnished to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out the purposes of this subchapter and that such report shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction of such government unless the cost of such publication is excessive in relation to the amount of the payments received by such government under this subchapter or other means of publicizing such report is more appropriate, in which case such report shall be publicized pursuant to rules prescribed by the Secretary;
  (4) an assurance that the requirements of section 6727 of this title will be complied with;
  (5) an assurance that the requirements of section 6728 of this title will be complied with;

  (8) an assurance that the State or unit of local government will spend amounts received under this subchapter only in accordance with the laws and procedures applicable to the expenditure of its own revenues.
