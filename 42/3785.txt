     If any applicant or recipient is dissatisfied with a final action with respect to section 3783, 3784, or 3789d(c)(2)(G) of this title, such applicant or recipient may, within sixty days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such applicant or recipient is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a petition for review of the action. A copy of the petition shall forthwith be transmitted by the petitioner to the Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, or the National Institute of Justice, as appropriate, and the Attorney General of the United States, who shall represent the Federal Government in the litigation.

The findings of fact by the Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, or the National Institute of Justice, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics, to take additional evidence to be made part of the record.
