  (a) Requirements established for flame resistant cables
     Trailing cables used in coal mines shall meet the requirements established by the Secretary for flame-resistant cables.
  (b) Circuit breakers; markings and visual observation of position of disconnection devices
     Short-circuit protection for trailing cables shall be provided by an automatic circuit breaker or other no less effective device approved by the Secretary of adequate current-interrupting capacity in each ungrounded conductor. Disconnecting devices used to disconnect power from trailing cables shall be plainly marked and identified and such devices shall be equipped or designed in such a manner that it can be determined by visual observation that the power is disconnected.
  (c) Distribution center junctions; safety connections
     When two or more trailing cables junction to the same distribution center, means shall be provided to assure against connecting a trailing cable to the wrong size circuit breaker.
  (d) Temporary splices; usable period; exceptions; quality
     One temporary splice may be made in any trailing cable. Such trailing cable may only be used for the next twenty-four hour period. No temporary splice shall be made in a trailing cable within twenty-five feet of the machine, except cable reel equipment. Temporary splices in trailing cables shall be made in a workmanlike manner and shall be mechanically strong and well insulated. Trailing cables or hand cables which have exposed wires or which have splices that heat or spark under load shall not be used. As used in this subsection, the term ””splice““ means the mechanical joining of one or more conductors that have been severed.
  (e) Permanent splices; quality
     When permanent splices in trailing cables are made, they shall be–
    (1) mechanically strong with adequate electrical conductivity and flexibility;
    (2) effectively insulated and sealed so as to exclude moisture; and
    (3) vulcanized or otherwise treated with suitable materials to provide flame-resistant qualities and good bonding to the outer jacket.
  (f) Clamping of cables
     Trailing cables shall be clamped to machines in a manner to protect the cables from damage and to prevent strain on the electrical connections. Trailing cables shall be adequately protected to prevent damage by mobile equipment.
  (g) Making and breaking of connections to junction boxes
     Trailing cable and power cable connections to junction boxes shall not be made or broken under load.
