     In order to promote useful opportunities in community service activities for individuals with disabilities who have poor employment prospects, the Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this part referred to as the ””Secretary““) is authorized to establish a community service employment pilot program for individuals with disabilities.

Such agreements may include provisions consistent with subsection (c) of this section for the payment of the costs of projects developed by such organizations and agencies in cooperation with the Secretary.

      (E) Such project (i) will result in an increase in employment opportunities over those opportunities which would otherwise be available, (ii) will not result in any displacement of currently employed workers (including partial displacement, such as a reduction in the hours of nonovertime work or wages or employment benefits), and (iii) will not impair existing contracts or result in the substitution of Federal funds for other funds in connection with work that would otherwise be performed.
      (F) Such project will not employ any eligible individual to perform work which is the same or substantially the same as that performed by any other person who is on layoff from employment with the agency or organization sponsoring such project.
      (G) Such project will utilize methods of recruitment and selection (including the listing of job vacancies with the State agency units designated under section 721(a)(2)(A) of this title to administer vocational rehabilitation services under this chapter) which will assure that the maximum number of eligible individuals will have an opportunity to participate in the project.
      (H) Such project will provide for (i) such training as may be necessary to make the most effective use of the skills and talents of individuals who are participating in the project, and (ii) during the period of such training, a reasonable subsistence allowance for such individuals and the payment of any other reasonable expenses related to such training.
      (I) Such project will provide safe and healthy working conditions for any eligible individual employed under such project and will pay any such individual at a rate of pay not lower than the rate of pay described in paragraph (2).
      (J) Such project will be established or administered with the advice of (i) persons competent in the field of service in which employment is being provided, and (ii) persons who are knowledgeable with regard to the needs of individuals with disabilities.

      (L) Such project will provide appropriate placement services for employees under the project to assist them in locating unsubsidized employment when the Federal assistance for the project terminates.
    (2) The rate of pay referred to in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (1) is the highest of the following:
      (A) the \1\N prevailing rate of pay for persons employed in similar occupations by the same employer.
      (B) The minimum wage which would be applicable to the employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] if such employee were not exempt from such Act under section 13 thereof [29 U.S.C. 213].
      (C) The State or local minimum wage for the most nearly comparable covered employment.
         The Department of Labor shall not issue any certificate of exemption under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 214(c)] with respect to any person employed in a project under this section.
  (c) Cost payments; non-Federal share
    (1) The Secretary may pay not to exceed 90 percent of the cost of any project which is the subject of an agreement entered into under subsection (b) of this section.
