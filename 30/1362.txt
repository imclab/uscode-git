    (1) Collective net worth of persons subject to liability

        (ii) are (as of the termination date) contributing sponsors of the terminated plan or members of their controlled groups.
      (B) Determination of net worth
         For purposes of this paragraph, the net worth of a person is–
        (i) determined on whatever basis best reflects, in the determination of the corporation, the current status of the person“s operations and prospects at the time chosen for determining the net worth of the person, and
        (ii) increased by the amount of any transfers of assets made by the person which are determined by the corporation to be improper under the circumstances, including any such transfers which would be inappropriate under title 11 if the person were a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of such title.
      (C) Timing of determination
         For purposes of this paragraph, determinations of net worth shall be made as of a day chosen by the corporation (during the 120-day period ending with the termination date) and shall be computed without regard to any liability under this section.
    (2) Pre-tax profits
       The term ””pre-tax profits““ means–
      (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), for any fiscal year of any person, such person“s consolidated net income (excluding any extraordinary charges to income and including any extraordinary credits to income) for such fiscal year, as shown on audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or

The corporation may by regulation require such information to be filed on such forms as may be necessary to determine the existence and amount of such pre-tax profits.
  (e) Treatment of substantial cessation of operations
     If an employer ceases operations at a facility in any location and, as a result of such cessation of operations, more than 20 percent of the total number of his employees who are participants under a plan established and maintained by him are separated from employment, the employer shall be treated with respect to that plan as if he were a substantial employer under a plan under which more than one employer makes contributions and the provisions of sections 1363, 1364, and 1365 of this title shall apply.
