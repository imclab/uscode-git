      (A) require corrective action to secure prompt compliance; and
      (B) impose the sanctions provided under subsection (f) of this section in the event of failure of the Governor to take the required corrective action.
    (8) The Secretary, in consultation with the Inspector General, shall review the implementation of this subsection and submit a report to the appropriate committees of the Congress, not later than October 1, 1995, evaluating the effectiveness of this subsection in ensuring fiscal accountability and containing such recommendations as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

The Comptroller General shall conduct the evaluations whenever he determines it necessary and he shall periodically report to the Congress on the findings of such evaluations.
    (2) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to relieve the Inspector General of the Department of Labor of his responsibilities under the Inspector General Act.

  (d) Recipient“s liability for noncomplying expenditures
     Every recipient shall repay to the United States amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with this chapter. The Secretary may offset such amounts against any other amount to which the recipient is or may be entitled under this chapter unless he determines that such recipient should be held liable pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. No such action shall be taken except after notice and opportunity for a hearing have been given to the recipient.
  (e) Conditions for recipient“s liability; conditions for recipient“s liability for subgrantee noncompliance; Secretary“s discretion
    (1) Each recipient shall be liable to repay such amounts, from funds other than funds received under this chapter, upon a determination that the misexpenditure of funds was due to willful disregard of the requirements of this chapter, gross negligence, or failure to observe accepted standards of administration. No such finding shall be made except after notice and opportunity for a fair hearing.
    (2) In determining whether to impose any sanction authorized by this section against a recipient for violations by a subgrantee of such recipient under this chapter or the regulations under this chapter, the Secretary shall first determine whether such recipient has adequately demonstrated that it has–

      (D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of this chapter or the regulations under this chapter by such subgrantee.
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the recipient has demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive the imposition of sanctions authorized by this section upon such recipient. The Secretary is authorized to impose any sanction consistent with the provisions of this chapter and any applicable Federal or State law directly against any subgrantee for violation of this chapter or the regulations under this chapter.
  (f) Emergency situations and immediate termination
     In emergency situations, if the Secretary determines it is necessary to protect the integrity of the funds or ensure the proper operation of the program, the Secretary may immediately terminate or suspend financial assistance, in whole or in part, if the recipient is given prompt notice and the opportunity for a subsequent hearing within 30 days after such termination or suspension. The Secretary shall not delegate any of the functions or authority specified in this subsection, other than to an officer whose appointment was required to be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

     If the Secretary determines that any recipient under this chapter has discharged or in any other manner discriminated against a participant or against any individual in connection with the administration of the program involved, or against any individual because such individual has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or investigation under or related to this chapter, or otherwise unlawfully denied to any individual a benefit to which that individual is entitled under the provisions of this chapter or the Secretary“s regulations, the Secretary shall, within thirty days, take such action or order such corrective measures, as necessary, with respect to the recipient or the aggrieved individual, or both.
