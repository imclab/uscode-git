  (a) Denial, suspension, modification, and revocation
    (1) The Administrator may deny certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of, and may deny the issuance or transfer of, a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery if the Administrator finds that the applicant, or the activities proposed to be undertaken by the applicant, do not meet the requirements set forth in section 1413(c) of this title, section 1415(a) of this title, or in any other provision of this chapter, or any regulation issued under this chapter, for the issuance or transfer of a license or permit.
    (2) The Administrator may–
      (A) in addition to, or in lieu of, the imposition of any civil penalty under section 1462(a) of this title, or in addition to the imposition of any fine under section 1463 of this title, suspend or revoke any license or permit issued under this chapter, or suspend or modify any particular activities under such a license or permit, if the licensee or permittee, as the case may be, substantially fails to comply with any provision of this chapter, any regulation issued under this chapter, or any term, condition, or restriction of the license or permit; and
      (B) suspend or modify particular activities under any license or permit, if the President determines that such suspension or modification is necessary (i) to avoid any conflict with any international obligation of the United States established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States, or (ii) to avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict.
    (3) No action may be taken by the Administrator to deny issuance or transfer of or to revoke any license or permit or, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, to suspend any license or permit or suspend or modify particular activities under a license or permit, unless the Administrator–
      (A) publishes in the Federal Register and gives the applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, written notice of the intention of the Administrator to deny the issuance or transfer of or to suspend, modify, or revoke the license or permit and the reason therefor; and
      (B) if the reason for the proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation is a deficiency which the applicant, licensee, or permittee can correct, affords the applicant, licensee, or permittee a reasonable time, but not more than 180 days from the date of the notice or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown, to correct such deficiency.
    (4) The Administrator shall deny issuance or transfer of, or suspend or revoke, any license or permit or order the suspension or modification of particular activities under a license or permit–
      (A) on the thirtieth day after the date of the notice given to the applicant, licensee, or permittee under paragraph (3)(A) unless before such day the applicant, licensee, or permittee requests a review of the proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation; or
      (B) on the last day of the period established under paragraph (3)(B) in which the applicant, licensee, or permittee must correct a deficiency, if such correction has not been made before such day.
  (b) Administrative review of proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation
     Any applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, who makes a timely request under subsection (a) of this section for review of a denial of issuance or transfer, or a suspension or revocation, of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or a suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is entitled to an adjudication on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing with respect to such denial or suspension, revocation, or modification.
  (c) Effect on activities; emergency orders
     The issuance of any notice of proposed suspension or revocation of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery or proposed suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit shall not affect the continuation of exploration or commercial recovery activities by the licensee or permittee. The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of this section and the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply when the President determines by Executive order that an immediate suspension of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is necessary for the reasons set forth in subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, or the Administrator determines that an immediate suspension of such a license or permit, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on the environment or to preserve the safety of life and property at sea, and the Administrator issues an emergency order requiring such immediate suspension.
  (d) Judicial review
     Any determination of the Administrator, after any appropriate administrative review under subsection (b) of this section, to certify or deny certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of, or to issue, deny issuance of, transfer, deny the transfer of, modify, renew, suspend, or revoke any license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or suspend or modify particular activities under such a license or permit, or any immediate suspension of such a license or permit, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.
