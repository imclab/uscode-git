  (a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts
     The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless–
    (1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds–
      (A) the sum of–
        (i) 90 percent of the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and
        (ii) 90 percent of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus
      (B) any excess noncash income (as determined under subsection (e)); and
    (2) either–
      (A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or
      (B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.
         For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ””non-REIT year““ means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.
  (b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest
    (1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts
       There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.
    (2) Real estate investment trust taxable income
       For purposes of this part, the term ””real estate investment trust taxable income““ means the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:
      (A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.
      (B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).
      (C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).
      (D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.
      (E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, section 856(c)(7)(C), and section 856(g)(5) for the taxable year.
      (F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.
    (3) Capital gains
      (A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains
         If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of–
        (i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and
        (ii) a tax determined at the rates provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.
      (B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders
         A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.
      (C) Definition of capital gain dividend
         For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.
      (D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains
        (i) Every shareholder of a real estate investment trust at the close of the trust“s taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the trust“s taxable year falls, such amount as the trust shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year), but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A)(ii) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the trust to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.
        (ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholders shall be allowed credit or refund as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.
        (iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the holder shall be increased with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).
        (iv) In the event of such designation, the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid by the real estate investment trust within 30 days after the close of its taxable year.
        (v) The earnings and profits of such real estate investment trust, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
        (vi) As used in this subparagraph, the terms ””shares““ and ””shareholders““ shall include beneficial interests and holders of beneficial interests, respectively.
      (E) Coordination with net operating loss provisions
         For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining–
        (i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and
        (ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.
      (F) Certain distributions
         In the case of a shareholder of a real estate investment trust to whom section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for such shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)–
        (i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder“s long-term capital gains, and
        (ii) shall be included in such shareholder“s gross income as a dividend from the real estate investment trust.
    (4) Income from foreclosure property
      (A) Imposition of tax
         A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).
      (B) Net income from foreclosure property
         For purposes of this part, the term ””net income from foreclosure property““ means the excess of–

        (ii) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the income referred to in clause (i).
    (5) Imposition of tax in case of failure to meet certain requirements
       If section 856(c)(6) applies to a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, there is hereby imposed on such trust a tax in an amount equal to the greater of–
      (A) the excess of–
        (i) 95 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over
        (ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2); or
      (B) the excess of–
        (i) 75 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over
        (ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3),
       multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deductions provided in paragraphs (2)(B) and (2)(E), without regard to any net operating loss deduction, and by excluding any net capital gain) and the denominator of which is the gross income for the taxable year (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions; gross income and gain from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e), but only to the extent such gross income and gain is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3)); long-term capital gain; and short-term capital gain to the extent of any short-term capital loss).

    (2) Section (1)(h)(11)
      (A) In general
         In any case in which–

        (ii) such trust meets the requirements of section 856(a) for the taxable year during which it paid such dividend,
         then, in computing qualified dividend income, there shall be taken into account only that portion of such dividend designated by the real estate investment trust.

         The aggregate amount which may be designated as qualified dividend income under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the sum of–
        (i) the qualified dividend income of the trust for the taxable year,
        (ii) the excess of–
          (I) the sum of the real estate investment trust taxable income computed under section 857(b)(2) for the preceding taxable year and the income subject to tax by reason of the application of the regulations under section 337(d) for such preceding taxable year, over

    (2) Coordination with tax on undistributed income
