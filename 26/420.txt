    (2) no amount shall be includible in the gross income of the employer maintaining the plan solely by reason of such transfer,
    (3) such transfer shall not be treated–
      (A) as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980, or
      (B) as a prohibited transaction for purposes of section 4975, and
    (4) the limitations of subsection (d) shall apply to such employer.
  (b) Qualified transfer
     For purposes of this section–
    (1) In general
       The term ””qualified transfer““ means a transfer–
      (A) of excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan to a health benefits account which is part of such plan in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990,
      (B) which does not contravene any other provision of law, and
      (C) with respect to which the following requirements are met in connection with the plan–
        (i) the use requirements of subsection (c)(1),
        (ii) the vesting requirements of subsection (c)(2), and
        (iii) the minimum cost requirements of subsection (c)(3).

    (3) Limitation on amount transferred
       The amount of excess pension assets which may be transferred in a qualified transfer shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the taxable year of the transfer for qualified current retiree health liabilities.
    (4) Special rule for 1990
      (A) In general
         Subject to the provisions of subsection (c), a transfer shall be treated as a qualified transfer if such transfer–
        (i) is made after the close of the taxable year preceding the employer“s first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990, and before the earlier of–
          (I) the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the return of tax for such preceding taxable year, or
          (II) the date such return is filed, and
        (ii) does not exceed the expenditures of the employer for qualified current retiree health liabilities for such preceding taxable year.
      (B) Deduction reduced
         The amount of the deductions otherwise allowable under this chapter to an employer for the taxable year preceding the employer“s first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990, shall be reduced by the amount of any qualified transfer to which this paragraph applies.
      (C) Coordination with reduction rule
         Subsection (e)(1)(B) shall not apply to a transfer described in subparagraph (A).

    (1) Use of transferred assets
      (A) In general
         Any assets transferred to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay qualified current retiree health liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under subsection (e)(1)(D)) for the taxable year of the transfer (whether directly or through reimbursement). In the case of a qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which subsection (f) applies, any assets so transferred may also be used to pay liabilities described in subsection (f)(2)(C).
      (B) Amounts not used to pay for health benefits
        (i) In general
           Any assets transferred to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) which are not used as provided in subparagraph (A) shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan.
        (ii) Tax treatment of amounts
           Any amount transferred out of an account under clause (i)–
          (I) shall not be includible in the gross income of the employer for such taxable year, but
          (II) shall be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980 (without regard to subsection (d) thereof).
      (C) Ordering rule
         For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of a health benefits account shall be treated as paid first out of the assets and income described in subparagraph (A).
    (2) Requirements relating to pension benefits accruing before transfer
      (A) In general
         The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the transfer, immediately before such separation).
      (B) Special rule for 1990
         In the case of a qualified transfer described in subsection (b)(4), the requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any participant who separated from service during the taxable year to which such transfer relates by recomputing such participant“s benefits as if subparagraph (A) had applied immediately before such separation.
    (3) Minimum cost requirements
      (A) In general
         The requirements of this paragraph are met if each group health plan or arrangement under which applicable health benefits are provided provides that the applicable employer cost for each taxable year during the cost maintenance period shall not be less than the higher of the applicable employer costs for each of the 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the qualified transfer or, in the case of a transfer which involves a plan maintained by an employer described in subsection (f)(2)(E)(i)(III), if the plan meets the requirements of subsection (f)(2)(D)(i)(II).
      (B) Applicable employer cost
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””applicable employer cost““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the amount determined by dividing–
        (i) the qualified current retiree health liabilities of the employer for such taxable year determined–
          (I) without regard to any reduction under subsection (e)(1)(B), and
          (II) in the case of a taxable year in which there was no qualified transfer, in the same manner as if there had been such a transfer at the end of the taxable year, by
        (ii) the number of individuals to whom coverage for applicable health benefits was provided during such taxable year.
      (C) Election to compute cost separately
         An employer may elect to have this paragraph applied separately with respect to individuals eligible for benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals not so eligible.
      (D) Cost maintenance period
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””cost maintenance period““ means the period of 5 taxable years beginning with the taxable year in which the qualified transfer occurs. If a taxable year is in two or more overlapping cost maintenance periods, this paragraph shall be applied by taking into account the highest applicable employer cost required to be provided under subparagraph (A) for such taxable year.
      (E) Regulations
        (i) In general
           The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent an employer who significantly reduces retiree health coverage during the cost maintenance period from being treated as satisfying the minimum cost requirement of this subsection.
        (ii) Insignificant cost reductions permitted
          (I) In general
             An eligible employer shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if, in lieu of any reduction of retiree health coverage permitted under the regulations prescribed under clause (i), the employer reduces applicable employer cost by an amount not in excess of the reduction in costs which would have occurred if the employer had made the maximum permissible reduction in retiree health coverage under such regulations. In applying such regulations to any subsequent taxable year, any reduction in applicable employer cost under this clause shall be treated as if it were an equivalent reduction in retiree health coverage.
          (II) Eligible employer
             For purposes of subclause (I), an employer shall be treated as an eligible employer for any taxable year if, for the preceding taxable year, the qualified current retiree health liabilities of the employer were at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer. For purposes of this subclause, the rules of paragraphs (2), (3)(B), and (3)(C) of section 448(c) shall apply in determining the amount of an employer“s gross receipts.
  (d) Limitations on employer
     For purposes of this title–
    (1) Deduction limitations
       No deduction shall be allowed–
      (A) for the transfer of any amount to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (or any retransfer to the plan under subsection (c)(1)(B)),
      (B) for qualified current retiree health liabilities paid out of the assets (and income) described in subsection (c)(1), or
      (C) for any amounts to which subparagraph (B) does not apply and which are paid for qualified current retiree health liabilities for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are not greater than the excess (if any) of–
        (i) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) (and income allocable thereto), over
        (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B).
    (2) No contributions allowed
       An employer may not contribute after December 31, 1990, any amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to qualified current retiree health liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1).

      (A) In general
         The term ””qualified current retiree health liabilities““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the aggregate amounts (including administrative expenses) which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer for such taxable year with respect to applicable health benefits provided during such taxable year if–
        (i) such benefits were provided directly by the employer, and
        (ii) the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
         For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rule of section 419(c)(3)(B) shall apply.
      (B) Reductions for amounts previously set aside
         The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by the amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as–
        (i) the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the qualified transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the qualified current retiree health liability, bears to
        (ii) the present value of the qualified current retiree health liabilities for all plan years (determined without regard to this subparagraph).

    (5) Application to multiemployer plans
       In the case of a multiemployer plan, this section shall be applied to any such plan–
      (A) by treating any reference in this section to an employer as a reference to all employers maintaining the plan (or, if appropriate, the plan sponsor), and
      (B) in accordance with such modifications of this section (and the provisions of this title relating to this section) as the Secretary determines appropriate to reflect the fact the plan is not maintained by a single employer.

        (ii) Requirement to maintain funded status
           If, as of any valuation date of any plan year in the transfer period, the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(B) (after application of clause (i)) exceeds the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(A), either–
          (I) the employer maintaining the plan shall make contributions to the plan in an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date, or
          (II) there is transferred from the health benefits account to the plan an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date.
      (C) Limitation on amount transferred
         Notwithstanding subsection (b)(3), the amount of the excess pension assets which may be transferred–
        (i) in the case of a qualified future transfer shall be equal to the sum of–

          (II) in the case of all other taxable years in the transfer period, the sum of the qualified current retiree health liabilities which the plan reasonably estimates, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary, will be incurred for each of such years, and
        (ii) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated, in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and generally accepted accounting principles, to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period for collectively bargained retiree health liabilities.
      (D) Minimum cost requirements
        (i) In general
           The requirements of subsection (c)(3) shall be treated as met if–

          (II) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, each collectively bargained group health plan under which collectively bargained health benefits are provided provides that the collectively bargained employer cost for each taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period shall not be less than the amount specified by the collective bargaining agreement.
        (ii) Election to maintain benefits for future transfers
           An employer may elect, in lieu of the requirements of clause (i)(I), to meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3) by meeting the requirements of such subsection (as in effect before the amendments made by section 535 of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999) for each of the years described in the period under clause (i)(I).
        (iii) Collectively bargained employer cost
           For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ””collectively bargained employer cost““ means the average cost per covered individual of providing collectively bargained retiree health benefits as determined in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Such agreement may provide for an appropriate reduction in the collectively bargained employer cost to take into account any portion of the collectively bargained retiree health benefits that is provided or financed by a government program or other source.

        (ii) Use of assets
           Any assets transferred to a health benefits account in a collectively bargained transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay collectively bargained retiree health liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under paragraph (6)(B)(iii)) for the taxable year of the transfer or for any subsequent taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period (whether directly or through reimbursement).
    (3) Coordination with other transfers
       In applying subsection (b)(3) to any subsequent transfer during a taxable year in a transfer period or collectively bargained cost maintenance period, qualified current retiree health liabilities shall be reduced by any such liabilities taken into account with respect to the qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which such period relates.
    (4) Special deduction rules for collectively bargained transfers
       In the case of a collectively bargained transfer–
      (A) the limitation under subsection (d)(1)(C) shall not apply, and
      (B) notwithstanding subsection (d)(2), an employer may contribute an amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to collectively bargained retiree health liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1)(B), and the deductibility of any such contribution shall be governed by the limits applicable to the deductibility of contributions to a welfare benefit fund under a collective bargaining agreement (as determined under section 419A(f)(5)(A)) without regard to whether such contributions are made to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund and without regard to the provisions of section 404 or the other provisions of this section.
       The Secretary shall provide rules to ensure that the application of this paragraph does not result in a deduction being allowed more than once for the same contribution or for 2 or more contributions or expenditures relating to the same collectively bargained retiree health liabilities.
    (5) Transfer period
       For purposes of this subsection, the term ””transfer period““ means, with respect to any transfer, a period of consecutive taxable years (not less than 2) specified in the election under paragraph (1) which begins and ends during the 10-taxable-year period beginning with the taxable year of the transfer.

           The amount determined under clause (i) shall be reduced by the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the collectively bargained transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the collectively bargained retiree health liabilities.
        (iii) Key employees excluded
           If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(I)(1)) \1\N with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing collectively bargained retiree health liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating collectively bargained employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(C).
