    (2) no amount shall be includible in the gross income of the employer maintaining the plan solely by reason of such transfer,
    (3) such transfer shall not be treated–

    (3) Limitation on amount transferred
       The amount of excess pension assets which may be transferred in a qualified transfer shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the taxable year of the transfer for qualified current retiree health liabilities.
    (4) Special rule for 1990
      (A) In general
         Subject to the provisions of subsection (c), a transfer shall be treated as a qualified transfer if such transfer–
        (i) is made after the close of the taxable year preceding the employer“s first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990, and before the earlier of–
          (I) the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the return of tax for such preceding taxable year, or
          (II) the date such return is filed, and
        (ii) does not exceed the expenditures of the employer for qualified current retiree health liabilities for such preceding taxable year.
      (B) Deduction reduced
         The amount of the deductions otherwise allowable under this chapter to an employer for the taxable year preceding the employer“s first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990, shall be reduced by the amount of any qualified transfer to which this paragraph applies.
      (C) Coordination with reduction rule
         Subsection (e)(1)(B) shall not apply to a transfer described in subparagraph (A).
    (5) Expiration

  (c) Requirements of plans transferring assets
    (1) Use of transferred assets
      (A) In general
         Any assets transferred to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay qualified current retiree health liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under subsection (e)(1)(D)) for the taxable year of the transfer (whether directly or through reimbursement).
      (B) Amounts not used to pay for health benefits
        (i) In general
           Any assets transferred to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) which are not used as provided in subparagraph (A) shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan.
        (ii) Tax treatment of amounts
           Any amount transferred out of an account under clause (i)–
          (I) shall not be includible in the gross income of the employer for such taxable year, but

      (C) Ordering rule
         For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of a health benefits account shall be treated as paid first out of the assets and income described in subparagraph (A).
    (2) Requirements relating to pension benefits accruing before transfer
      (A) In general
         The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the transfer, immediately before such separation).
      (B) Special rule for 1990
         In the case of a qualified transfer described in subsection (b)(4), the requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any participant who separated from service during the taxable year to which such transfer relates by recomputing such participant“s benefits as if subparagraph (A) had applied immediately before such separation.
    (3) Minimum cost requirements
      (A) In general
         The requirements of this paragraph are met if each group health plan or arrangement under which applicable health benefits are provided provides that the applicable employer cost for each taxable year during the cost maintenance period shall not be less than the higher of the applicable employer costs for each of the 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the qualified transfer.
      (B) Applicable employer cost
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””applicable employer cost““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the amount determined by dividing–
        (i) the qualified current retiree health liabilities of the employer for such taxable year determined–
          (I) without regard to any reduction under subsection (e)(1)(B), and
          (II) in the case of a taxable year in which there was no qualified transfer, in the same manner as if there had been such a transfer at the end of the taxable year, by
        (ii) the number of individuals to whom coverage for applicable health benefits was provided during such taxable year.
      (C) Election to compute cost separately
         An employer may elect to have this paragraph applied separately with respect to individuals eligible for benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals not so eligible.
      (D) Cost maintenance period
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””cost maintenance period““ means the period of 5 taxable years beginning with the taxable year in which the qualified transfer occurs. If a taxable year is in two or more overlapping cost maintenance periods, this paragraph shall be applied by taking into account the highest applicable employer cost required to be provided under subparagraph (A) for such taxable year.
      (E) Regulations
        (i) In general
           The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent an employer who significantly reduces retiree health coverage during the cost maintenance period from being treated as satisfying the minimum cost requirement of this subsection.
        (ii) Insignificant cost reductions permitted
          (I) In general
             An eligible employer shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if, in lieu of any reduction of retiree health coverage permitted under the regulations prescribed under clause (i), the employer reduces applicable employer cost by an amount not in excess of the reduction in costs which would have occurred if the employer had made the maximum permissible reduction in retiree health coverage under such regulations. In applying such regulations to any subsequent taxable year, any reduction in applicable employer cost under this clause shall be treated as if it were an equivalent reduction in retiree health coverage.
          (II) Eligible employer
             For purposes of subclause (I), an employer shall be treated as an eligible employer for any taxable year if, for the preceding taxable year, the qualified current retiree health liabilities of the employer were at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer. For purposes of this subclause, the rules of paragraphs (2), (3)(B), and (3)(C) of section 448(c) shall apply in determining the amount of an employer“s gross receipts.
  (d) Limitations on employer
     For purposes of this title–
    (1) Deduction limitations
       No deduction shall be allowed–
      (A) for the transfer of any amount to a health benefits account in a qualified transfer (or any retransfer to the plan under subsection (c)(1)(B)),
      (B) for qualified current retiree health liabilities paid out of the assets (and income) described in subsection (c)(1), or
      (C) for any amounts to which subparagraph (B) does not apply and which are paid for qualified current retiree health liabilities for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are not greater than the excess (if any) of–
        (i) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) (and income allocable thereto), over
        (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B).
    (2) No contributions allowed
       An employer may not contribute after December 31, 1990, any amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to qualified current retiree health liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1).

      (A) In general
         The term ””qualified current retiree health liabilities““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the aggregate amounts (including administrative expenses) which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer for such taxable year with respect to applicable health benefits provided during such taxable year if–
        (i) such benefits were provided directly by the employer, and
        (ii) the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
         For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rule of section 419(c)(3)(B) shall apply.
      (B) Reductions for amounts previously set aside
         The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by the amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as–
        (i) the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the qualified transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the qualified current retiree health liability, bears to
        (ii) the present value of the qualified current retiree health liabilities for all plan years (determined without regard to this subparagraph).
      (C) Applicable health benefits
         The term ””applicable health benefits““ means health benefits or coverage which are provided to–
        (i) retired employees who, immediately before the qualified transfer, are entitled to receive such benefits upon retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, and
        (ii) their spouses and dependents.
      (D) Key employees excluded
         If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)) with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing qualified current retiree health liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating applicable employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(B).

        (i) the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(A)(i), or
        (ii) 125 percent of current liability (as defined in section 412(c)(7)(B)).
       The determination under this paragraph shall be made as of the most recent valuation date of the plan preceding the qualified transfer.
    (3) Health benefits account
       The term ””health benefits account““ means an account established and maintained under section 401(h).
    (4) Coordination with section 412
       In the case of a qualified transfer to a health benefits account–
      (A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year, and
      (B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to the amount of such transfer (reduced by any amounts transferred back to the pension plan under subsection (c)(1)(B)) and for which amortization charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year in which such transfer occurs, except that such section shall be applied to such amount by substituting ””10 plan years““ for ””5 plan years““.
