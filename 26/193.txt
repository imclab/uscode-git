  (a) Allowance of deduction
     There shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year an amount equal to the qualified tertiary injectant expenses of the taxpayer for tertiary injectants injected during such taxable year.
  (b) Qualified tertiary injectant expenses
     For purposes of this section–
    (1) In general
       The term ””qualified tertiary injectant expenses““ means any cost paid or incurred (whether or not chargeable to capital account) for any tertiary injectant (other than a hydrocarbon injectant which is recoverable) which is used as a part of a tertiary recovery method.
    (2) Hydrocarbon injectant
       The term ””hydrocarbon injectant““ includes natural gas, crude oil, and any other injectant which is comprised of more than an insignificant amount of natural gas or crude oil. The term does not include any tertiary injectant which is hydrocarbon-based, or a hydrocarbon-derivative, and which is comprised of no more than an insignificant amount of natural gas or crude oil. For purposes of this paragraph, that portion of a hydrocarbon injectant which is not a hydrocarbon shall not be treated as a hydrocarbon injectant.
