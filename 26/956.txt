     In the case of any controlled foreign corporation, the amount determined under this section with respect to any United States shareholder for any taxable year is the lesser of–
    (1) the excess (if any) of–
      (A) such shareholder“s pro rata share of the average of the amounts of United States property held (directly or indirectly) by the controlled foreign corporation as of the close of each quarter of such taxable year, over
      (B) the amount of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) with respect to such shareholder, or
    (2) such shareholder“s pro rata share of the applicable earnings of such controlled foreign corporation.
       The amount taken into account under paragraph (1) with respect to any property shall be its adjusted basis as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits, reduced by any liability to which the property is subject.
  (b) Special rules
    (1) Applicable earnings
       For purposes of this section, the term ””applicable earnings““ means, with respect to any controlled foreign corporation, the sum of–

      (B) the average referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) for such taxable year shall be determined by only taking into account quarters ending on or before such last day, and
      (C) in determining applicable earnings, the amount taken into account by reason of being described in paragraph (2) of section 316(a) shall be the portion of the amount so described which is allocable (on a pro rata basis) to the part of such year during which the corporation is a controlled foreign corporation.
