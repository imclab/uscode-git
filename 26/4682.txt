         No tax shall be imposed by section 4681–
        (i) on the use of any ozone-depleting chemical in the manufacture or production of any other chemical if the ozone-depleting chemical is entirely consumed in such use,
        (ii) on the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of any ozone-depleting chemical–
          (I) for a use by the purchaser which meets the requirements of clause (i), or
          (II) for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for a use by the second purchaser which meets the requirements of clause (i).
         Clause (ii) shall apply only if the manufacturer, producer, and importer, and the 1st and 2d purchasers (if any), meet such registration requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
      (B) Credit or refund
         Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if–
        (i) a tax under this subchapter was paid with respect to any ozone-depleting chemical, and
        (ii) such chemical was used (and entirely consumed) by any person in the manufacture or production of any other chemical,
         then an amount equal to the tax so paid shall be allowed as a credit or refund (without interest) to such person in the same manner as if it were an overpayment of tax imposed by section 4681.
    (3) Exports

           The aggregate tax benefit allowable under subparagraph (A) with respect to ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured, produced, or imported by any person during a calendar year shall not exceed the sum of–
          (I) the amount equal to the 1986 export percentage of the aggregate tax which would (but for this subsection and subsection (g)) be imposed by this subchapter with respect to the maximum quantity of ozone-depleting chemicals permitted to be manufactured or produced by such person during such calendar year under regulations prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency (other than chemicals with respect to which subclause (II) applies),
          (II) the aggregate tax which would (but for this subsection and subsection (g)) be imposed by this subchapter with respect to any additional production allowance granted to such person with respect to ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured or produced by such person during such calendar year by the Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 82 (as in effect on September 14, 1989), and
          (III) the aggregate tax which was imposed by this subchapter with respect to ozone-depleting chemicals imported by such person during the calendar year.
        (ii) 1986 export percentage
           A person“s 1986 export percentage is the percentage equal to the ozone-depletion factor adjusted pounds of ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured or produced by such person during 1986 which were exported during 1986, divided by the ozone-depletion factor adjusted pounds of all ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured or produced by such person during 1986. The percentage determined under the preceding sentence shall be computed by taking into account the sum of such person“s direct 1986 exports (as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency) and such person“s indirect 1986 exports (as allocated to such person by such Agency in determining such person“s consumption and production rights for ozone-depleting chemicals).
      (C) Separate application of limit for newly listed chemicals
        (i) In general
           Subparagraph (B) shall be applied separately with respect to newly listed chemicals and other chemicals.
