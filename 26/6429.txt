  (a) In general
     Each taxpayer who was allowed a credit under section 24 on the return for the taxpayer“s first taxable year beginning in 2002 shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such taxable year in an amount equal to the child tax credit refund amount (if any) for such taxable year.
  (b) Child tax credit refund amount
     For purposes of this section, the child tax credit refund amount is the amount by which the aggregate credits allowed under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 for such first taxable year would have been increased if–
    (1) the per child amount under section 24(a)(2) for such year were $1,000,
    (2) only qualifying children (as defined in section 24(c)) of the taxpayer for such year who had not attained age 17 as of December 31, 2003, were taken into account, and
    (3) section 24(d)(1)(B)(ii) did not apply.
  (c) Timing of payments
     In the case of any overpayment attributable to this section, the Secretary shall, subject to the provisions of this title, refund or credit such overpayment as rapidly as possible and, to the extent practicable, before October 1, 2003. No refund or credit shall be made or allowed under this section after December 31, 2003.
  (d) Coordination with child tax credit
    (1) In general
       The amount of credit which would (but for this subsection and section 26) be allowed under section 24 for the taxpayer“s first taxable year beginning in 2003 shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the payments made to the taxpayer under this section. Any failure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as arising out of a mathematical or clerical error and assessed according to section 6213(b)(1).
    (2) Joint returns
       In the case of a payment under this section with respect to a joint return, half of such payment shall be treated as having been made to each individual filing such return.
  (e) No interest
     No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment attributable to this section.
