       to the extent such dividends, interest, amounts, or distributive share is attributable to foreign oil and gas extraction income, or to foreign oil related income, as the case may be; except that interest described in subparagraph (A) shall not be taken into account in computing foreign oil and gas extraction income but shall be taken into account in computing foreign oil-related income.
    (4) Recapture of foreign oil and gas losses by recharacterizing later combined foreign oil and gas income
      (A) In general
         The combined foreign oil and gas income of a taxpayer for a taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced–

         The reduction under this paragraph shall be equal to the lesser of–
        (i) the foreign oil and gas extraction income of the taxpayer for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph), or
        (ii) the excess of–
          (I) the aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 2009, over
          (II) so much of such aggregate amount as was recharacterized under this paragraph (as in effect before and after the date of the enactment of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008) for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.
      (C) Reduction for post-2008 foreign oil and gas losses
         The reduction under this paragraph shall be equal to the lesser of–

           For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””foreign oil and gas loss““ means the amount by which–
          (I) the gross income for the taxable year from sources without the United States and its possessions (whether or not the taxpayer chooses the benefits of this subpart for such taxable year) taken into account in determining the combined foreign oil and gas income for such year, is exceeded by
          (II) the sum of the deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto.
        (ii) Net operating loss deduction not taken into account
           For purposes of clause (i), the net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year under section 172(a) shall not be taken into account.

  (d) Disregard of certain posted prices, etc.
     For purposes of this chapter, in determining the amount of taxable income in the case of foreign oil and gas extraction income, if the oil or gas is disposed of, or is acquired other than from the government of a foreign country, at a posted price (or other pricing arrangement) which differs from the fair market value for such oil or gas, such fair market value shall be used in lieu of such posted price (or other pricing arrangement).

  (f) Carryback and carryover of disallowed credits
    (1) In general
       If the amount of the foreign oil and gas taxes paid or accrued during any taxable year exceeds the limitation provided by subsection (a) for such taxable year (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the ””unused credit year““), such excess shall be deemed to be foreign oil and gas taxes paid or accrued in the first preceding taxable year and in any of the first 10 succeeding taxable year,\2\N in that order and to the extent not deemed tax paid or accrued in a prior taxable year by reason of the limitation imposed by paragraph (2). Such amount deemed paid or accrued in any taxable year may be availed of only as a tax credit and not as a deduction and only if the taxpayer for such year chooses to have the benefits of this subpart as to taxes paid or accrued for that year to foreign countries or possessions.
    (2) Limitation
       The amount of the unused foreign oil and gas taxes which under paragraph (1) may be deemed paid or accrued in any preceding or succeeding taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of–
      (A) the amount by which the limitation provided by subsection (a) for such taxable year exceeds the sum of–
        (i) the foreign oil and gas taxes paid or accrued during such taxable year, plus
        (ii) the amounts of the foreign oil and gas taxes which by reason of this subsection are deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year and are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year; or
      (B) the amount by which the limitation provided by section 904 for such taxable year exceeds the sum of–
        (i) the taxes paid or accrued (or deemed to have been paid under section 902 or 960) to all foreign countries and possessions of the United States during such taxable year,
        (ii) the amount of such taxes which were deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year under section 904(c) and which are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year, plus
        (iii) the amount of the foreign oil and gas taxes which by reason of this subsection are deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year and are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year.
    (3) Special rules
      (A) In the case of any taxable year which is an unused credit year under this subsection and which is an unused credit year under section 904(c), the provisions of this subsection shall be applied before section 904(c).
      (B) For purposes of determining the amount of taxes paid or accrued in any taxable year which may be deemed paid or accrued in a preceding or succeeding taxable year under section 904(c), any tax deemed paid or accrued in such preceding or succeeding taxable year under this subsection shall be considered to be tax paid or accrued in such preceding or succeeding taxable year.
    (4) Transition rules for pre-2009 and 2009 disallowed credits
      (A) Pre-2009 credits
         In the case of any unused credit year beginning before January 1, 2009, this subsection shall be applied to any unused oil and gas extraction taxes carried from such unused credit year to a year beginning after December 31, 2008–
        (i) by substituting ””oil and gas extraction taxes““ for ””foreign oil and gas taxes““ each place it appears in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), and
        (ii) by computing, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the limitation under subparagraph (A) for the year to which such taxes are carried by substituting ””foreign oil and gas extraction income““ for ””foreign oil and gas income““ in subsection (a).
      (B) 2009 credits
         In the case of any unused credit year beginning in 2009, the amendments made to this subsection by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 shall be treated as being in effect for any preceding year beginning before January 1, 2009, solely for purposes of determining how much of the unused foreign oil and gas taxes for such unused credit year may be deemed paid or accrued in such preceding year.
