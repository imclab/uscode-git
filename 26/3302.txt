   The Congress finds that–
  (1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;
  (2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;
  (3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;
  (4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
  (5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;
  (6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and
  (7) these services are part of the Federal Government“s continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.
