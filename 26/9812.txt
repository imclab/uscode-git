  (a) In general
    (1) Aggregate lifetime limits
       In the case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits–
      (A) No lifetime limit
         If the plan does not include an aggregate lifetime limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits, the plan may not impose any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.
      (B) Lifetime limit
         If the plan includes an aggregate lifetime limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits (in this paragraph referred to as the ””applicable lifetime limit““), the plan shall either–
        (i) apply the applicable lifetime limit both to the medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or
        (ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.
      (C) Rule in case of different limits
         In the case of a plan that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an average aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.
    (2) Annual limits
       In the case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits–
      (A) No annual limit
         If the plan does not include an annual limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits, the plan may not impose any annual limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.
      (B) Annual limit
         If the plan includes an annual limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits (in this paragraph referred to as the ””applicable annual limit““), the plan shall either–
        (i) apply the applicable annual limit both to medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or
        (ii) not include any annual limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable annual limit.
      (C) Rule in case of different limits
         In the case of a plan that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different annual limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits by substituting for the applicable annual limit an average annual limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the annual limits applicable to such categories.
    (3) Financial requirements and treatment limitations
      (A) In general
         In the case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, such plan shall ensure that–
        (i) the financial requirements applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan, and there are no separate cost sharing requirements that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits; and
        (ii) the treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.
      (B) Definitions
         In this paragraph:
        (i) Financial requirement
           The term ””financial requirement““ includes deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, but excludes an aggregate lifetime limit and an annual limit subject to paragraphs (1) and (2),\1\N
        (ii) Predominant
           A financial requirement or treatment limit is considered to be predominant if it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement.

           The term ””treatment limitation““ includes limits on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment.
    (4) Availability of plan information
       The criteria for medical necessity determinations made under the plan with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits shall be made available by the plan administrator in accordance with regulations to any current or potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request. The reason for any denial under the plan of reimbursement or payment for services with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the case of any participant or beneficiary shall, on request or as otherwise required, be made available by the plan administrator to the participant or beneficiary in accordance with regulations.
    (5) Out-of-network providers

For purposes of the preceding sentence, all persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (T3oK) of section 414 shall be treated as 1 employer and rules similar to rules of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 4980D(d)(2) shall apply.
    (2) Cost exemption
      (A) In general

An employer may elect to continue to apply mental health and substance use disorder parity pursuant to this section with respect to the group health plan involved regardless of any increase in total costs.
      (B) Applicable percentage
         With respect to a plan, the applicable percentage described in this subparagraph shall be–

        (ii) 1 percent in the case of each subsequent plan year.
      (C) Determinations by actuaries
         Determinations as to increases in actual costs under a plan for purposes of this section shall be made and certified by a qualified and licensed actuary who is a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries. All such determinations shall be in a written report prepared by the actuary.

      (E) Notification
        (i) In general
           A group health plan that, based upon a certification described under subparagraph (C), qualifies for an exemption under this paragraph, and elects to implement the exemption, shall promptly notify the Secretary, the appropriate State agencies, and participants and beneficiaries in the plan of such election.
        (ii) Requirement
           A notification to the Secretary under clause (i) shall include–
          (I) a description of the number of covered lives under the plan involved at the time of the notification, and as applicable, at the time of any prior election of the cost-exemption under this paragraph by such plan;
          (II) for both the plan year upon which a cost exemption is sought and the year prior, a description of the actual total costs of coverage with respect to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits under the plan; and

          (I) a breakdown of States by the size and type of employers submitting such notification; and
          (II) a summary of the data received under clause (ii).
      (F) Audits by appropriate agencies
         To determine compliance with this paragraph, the Secretary may audit the books and records of a group health plan relating to an exemption, including any actuarial reports prepared pursuant to subparagraph (C), during the 6 year period following the notification of such exemption under subparagraph (E). A State agency receiving a notification under subparagraph (E) may also conduct such an audit with respect to an exemption covered by such notification.
  (d) Separate application to each option offered
     In the case of a group health plan that offers a participant or beneficiary two or more benefit package options under the plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied separately with respect to each such option.
