          (III) in the case of any plan, by reason of the failure of the plan to initially qualify or the failure of contributions to be deductible.
    (3) Exception for employee stock ownership plans
      (A) In general
         If, upon an employer reversion from a qualified plan, any applicable amount is transferred from such plan to an employee stock ownership plan described in section 4975(e)(7) or a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as described in section 409), such amount shall not be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of this section (or includible in the gross income of the employer) if–
        (i) the requirements of subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) are met, and
        (ii) under the plan, employer securities to which subparagraph (B) applies must, except to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(28), remain in the plan until distribution to participants in accordance with the provisions of such plan.
      (B) Investment in employer securities
         The requirements of this subparagraph are met if, within 90 days after the transfer (or such longer period as the Secretary may prescribe), the amount transferred is invested in employer securities (as defined in section 409(T3lK)) or used to repay loans used to purchase such securities.
      (C) Allocation requirements
         The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the portion of the amount transferred which is not allocated under the plan to accounts of participants in the plan year in which the transfer occurs–
        (i) is credited to a suspense account and allocated from such account to accounts of participants no less rapidly than ratably over a period not to exceed 7 years, and
        (ii) when allocated to accounts of participants under the plan, is treated as an employer contribution for purposes of section 415(c), except that–

          (II) no additional employer contributions shall be permitted to an employee stock ownership plan described in subparagraph (A) of the employer before the allocation of such amount.
         The amount allocated in the year of transfer shall not be less than the lesser of the maximum amount allowable under section 415 or \1/8\ of the amount attributable to the securities acquired. In the case of dividends on securities held in the suspense account, the requirements of this subparagraph are met only if the dividends are allocated to accounts of participants or paid to participants in proportion to their accounts, or used to repay loans used to purchase employer securities.

      (G) Amount transferred to include income thereon, etc.
         The amount transferred shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) unless amounts attributable to such amount also meet such requirements.
    (4) Time for payment of tax
       For purposes of subtitle F, the time for payment of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be the last day of the month following the month in which the employer reversion occurs.

    (2) Qualified replacement plan
       For purposes of this subsection, the term ””qualified replacement plan““ means a qualified plan established or maintained by the employer in connection with a qualified plan termination (hereinafter referred to as the ””replacement plan““) with respect to which the following requirements are met:

          (II) the amount determined under clause (ii).
        (ii) Reduction for increase in benefits
           The amount determined under this clause is an amount equal to the present value of the aggregate increases in the accrued benefits under the terminated plan of any participants or beneficiaries pursuant to a plan amendment which–
          (I) is adopted during the 60-day period ending on the date of termination of the qualified plan, and
          (II) takes effect immediately on the termination date.

          (II) credited to a suspense account and allocated from such account to accounts of participants no less rapidly than ratably over the 7-plan-year period beginning with the year of the transfer.
        (ii) Coordination with section 415 limitation
           If, by reason of any limitation under section 415, any amount credited to a suspense account under clause (i)(II) may not be allocated to a participant before the close of the 7-year period under such clause–
          (I) such amount shall be allocated to the accounts of other participants, and
          (II) if any portion of such amount may not be allocated to other participants by reason of any such limitation, shall be allocated to the participant as provided in section 415.
        (iii) Treatment of income
           Any income on any amount credited to a suspense account under clause (i)(II) shall be allocated to accounts of participants no less rapidly than ratably over the remainder of the period determined under such clause (after application of clause (ii)).

    (3) Pro rata benefit increases
      (A) In general
         The requirements of this paragraph are met if a plan amendment to the terminated plan is adopted in connection with the termination of the plan which provides pro rata increases in the accrued benefits of all qualified participants which–
        (i) have an aggregate present value not less than 20 percent of the maximum amount which the employer could receive as an employer reversion without regard to this subsection, and
        (ii) take effect immediately on the termination date.
      (B) Pro rata increase
         For purposes of subparagraph (A), a pro rata increase is an increase in the present value of the accrued benefit of each qualified participant in an amount which bears the same ratio to the aggregate amount determined under subparagraph (A)(i) as–
        (i) the present value of such participant“s accrued benefit (determined without regard to this subsection), bears to
        (ii) the aggregate present value of accrued benefits of the terminated plan (as so determined).
         Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the aggregate increases in the present value of the accrued benefits of qualified participants who are not active participants shall not exceed 40 percent of the aggregate amount determined under subparagraph (A)(i) by substituting ””equal to““ for ””not less than““.
    (4) Coordination with other provisions
      (A) Limitations
         A benefit may not be increased under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (3)(A), and an amount may not be allocated to a participant under paragraph (2)(C), if such increase or allocation would result in a failure to meet any requirement under section 401(a)(4) or 415.
      (B) Treatment as employer contributions
         Any increase in benefits under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (3)(A), or any allocation of any amount (or income allocable thereto) to any account under paragraph (2)(C), shall be treated as an annual benefit or annual addition for purposes of section 415.
      (C) 10-year participation requirement
         Except as provided by the Secretary, section 415(b)(5)(D) shall not apply to any increase in benefits by reason of this subsection to the extent that the application of this subparagraph does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)).

      (C) Reallocation of increase
         Except as provided in paragraph (2)(C), if any benefit increase is reduced by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (3)(A)(ii) or paragraph (4), the amount of such reduction shall be allocated to the remaining participants on the same basis as other increases (and shall be treated as meeting any allocation requirement of this subsection).
      (D) Plans taken into account
         For purposes of determining whether there is a qualified replacement plan under paragraph (2), the Secretary may provide that–
        (i) 2 or more plans may be treated as 1 plan, or
        (ii) a plan of a successor employer may be taken into account.
