       For purposes of this section–

         The term ””amortizable section 197 intangible““ shall not include any section 197 intangible which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (d)(1) (or for which depreciation or amortization would not have been allowable but for this section) and which is acquired by the taxpayer after the date of the enactment of this section, if–
        (i) the intangible was held or used at any time on or after July 25, 1991, and on or before such date of enactment by the taxpayer or a related person,
        (ii) the intangible was acquired from a person who held such intangible at any time on or after July 25, 1991, and on or before such date of enactment, and, as part of the transaction, the user of such intangible does not change, or
        (iii) the taxpayer grants the right to use such intangible to a person (or a person related to such person) who held or used such intangible at any time on or after July 25, 1991, and on or before such date of enactment.

For purposes of this subparagraph, deductions allowable under section 1253(d) shall be treated as deductions allowable for amortization.

         If–
        (i) subparagraph (A) would not apply to an intangible acquired by the taxpayer but for the last sentence of subparagraph (C)(i), and
        (ii) the person from whom the taxpayer acquired the intangible elects, notwithstanding any other provision of this title–
          (I) to recognize gain on the disposition of the intangible, and
          (II) to pay a tax on such gain which, when added to any other income tax on such gain under this title, equals such gain multiplied by the highest rate of income tax applicable to such person under this title,
              then subparagraph (A) shall apply to the intangible only to the extent that the taxpayer“s adjusted basis in the intangible exceeds the gain recognized under clause (ii)(I).
      (C) Related person defined
         For purposes of this paragraph–
        (i) Related person
           A person (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the ””related person““) is related to any person if–
          (I) the related person bears a relationship to such person specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1), or

      (F) Anti-abuse rules
         The term ””amortizable section 197 intangible““ does not include any section 197 intangible acquired in a transaction, one of the principal purposes of which is to avoid the requirement of subsection (c)(1) that the intangible be acquired after the date of the enactment of this section or to avoid the provisions of subparagraph (A).
