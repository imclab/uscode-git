    (2) Limited increases in death benefit permitted
       Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A)–
      (A) for purposes of computing the guideline level premium, an increase in the death benefit which is provided in the contract may be taken into account but only to the extent necessary to prevent a decrease in the excess of the death benefit over the cash surrender value of the contract,
      (B) for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the increase described in subparagraph (A) may be taken into account if the contract will meet such test at all times assuming that the net level reserve (determined as if level annual premiums were paid for the contract over a period not ending before the insured attains age 95) is substituted for the net single premium, and
      (C) for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the death benefit increases may be taken into account if the contract–
        (i) has an initial death benefit of $5,000 or less and a maximum death benefit of $25,000 or less,
        (ii) provides for a fixed predetermined annual increase not to exceed 10 percent of the initial death benefit or 8 percent of the death benefit at the end of the preceding year, and

         In the case of any additional benefit which is not a qualified additional benefit–
        (i) such benefit shall not be treated as a future benefit, and
        (ii) any charge for such benefit which is not prefunded shall not be treated as a premium.
    (6) Premium payments not disqualifying contract
       The payment of a premium which would result in the sum of the premiums paid exceeding the guideline premium limitation shall be disregarded for purposes of subsection (a)(2) if the amount of such premium does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent the termination of the contract on or before the end of the contract year (but only if the contract will have no cash surrender value at the end of such extension period).
