      (B) provides that no distribution (other than a distribution of income) may be made from the trust unless a trustee who is an individual citizen of the United States or a domestic corporation has the right to withhold from such distribution the tax imposed by this section on such distribution,
    (2) such trust meets such requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe to ensure the collection of any tax imposed by subsection (b), and
    (3) an election under this section by the executor of the decedent applies to such trust.
  (b) Tax treatment of trust
    (1) Imposition of estate tax
       There is hereby imposed an estate tax on–

    (2) Amount of tax
      (A) In general
         In the case of any taxable event, the amount of the estate tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall be the amount equal to–
        (i) the tax which would have been imposed under section 2001 on the estate of the decedent if the taxable estate of the decedent had been increased by the sum of–
          (I) the amount involved in such taxable event, plus
          (II) the aggregate amount involved in previous taxable events with respect to qualified domestic trusts of such decedent, reduced by
        (ii) the tax which would have been imposed under section 2001 on the estate of the decedent if the taxable estate of the decedent had been increased by the amount referred to in clause (i)(II).
      (B) Tentative tax where tax of decedent not finally determined
        (i) In general
           If the tax imposed on the estate of the decedent under section 2001 is not finally determined before the taxable event, the amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) on such event shall be determined by using the highest rate of tax in effect under section 2001 as of the date of the decedent“s death.
        (ii) Refund of excess when tax finally determined
           If–
          (I) the amount of the tax determined under clause (i), exceeds

              such excess shall be allowed as a credit or refund (with interest) if claim therefor is filed not later than 1 year after the date of such final determination.
      (C) Special rule where decedent has more than 1 qualified domestic trust
         If there is more than 1 qualified domestic trust with respect to any decedent, the amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to such trusts shall be determined by using the highest rate of tax in effect under section 2001 as of the date of the decedent“s death (and the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) shall not apply) unless, pursuant to a designation made by the decedent“s executor, there is 1 person–
        (i) who is an individual citizen of the United States or a domestic corporation and is responsible for filing all returns of tax imposed under paragraph (1) with respect to such trusts and for paying all tax so imposed, and
        (ii) who meets such requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

      (A) Tax on distributions
         The estate tax imposed by paragraph (1)(A) shall be due and payable on the 15th day of the 4th month following the calendar year in which the taxable event occurs; except that the estate tax imposed by paragraph (1)(A) on distributions during the calendar year in which the surviving spouse dies shall be due and payable not later than the date on which the estate tax imposed by paragraph (1)(B) is due and payable.

       If the surviving spouse of the decedent becomes a citizen of the United States and if–

    (15) No tax on certain distributions
       No tax shall be imposed by paragraph (1) on any distribution to the surviving spouse to the extent such distribution is to reimburse such surviving spouse for any tax imposed by subtitle A on any item of income of the trust to which such surviving spouse is not entitled under the terms of the trust.
