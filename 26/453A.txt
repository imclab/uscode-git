    (2) Computation of interest
       For purposes of paragraph (1), the interest for any taxable year shall be an amount equal to the product of–
      (A) the applicable percentage of the deferred tax liability with respect to such obligation, multiplied by
      (B) the underpayment rate in effect under section 6621(a)(2) for the month with or within which the taxable year ends.
    (3) Deferred tax liability
       For purposes of this section, the term ””deferred tax liability““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the product of–
      (A) the amount of gain with respect to an obligation which has not been recognized as of the close of such taxable year, multiplied by
      (B) the maximum rate of tax in effect under section 1 or 11, whichever is appropriate, for such taxable year.
       For purposes of applying the preceding sentence with respect to so much of the gain which, when recognized, will be treated as long-term capital gain, the maximum rate on net capital gain under section 1(h) or 1201 (whichever is appropriate) shall be taken into account.

  (d) Pledges, etc., of installment obligations
    (1) In general
       For purposes of section 453, if any indebtedness (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as ””secured indebtedness““) is secured by an installment obligation to which this section applies, the net proceeds of the secured indebtedness shall be treated as a payment received on such installment obligation as of the later of–
      (A) the time the indebtedness becomes secured indebtedness, or
      (B) the time the proceeds of such indebtedness are received by the taxpayer.
    (2) Limitation based on total contract price
       The amount treated as received under paragraph (1) by reason of any secured indebtedness shall not exceed the excess (if any) of–
      (A) the total contract price, over
      (B) any portion of the total contract price received under the contract before the later of the times referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) (including amounts previously treated as received under paragraph (1) but not including amounts not taken into account by reason of paragraph (3)).

    (4) Secured indebtedness
       For purposes of this subsection indebtedness is secured by an installment obligation to the extent that payment of principal or interest on such indebtedness is directly secured (under the terms of the indebtedness or any underlying arrangements) by any interest in such installment obligation. A payment shall be treated as directly secured by an interest in an installment obligation to the extent an arrangement allows the taxpayer to satisfy all or a portion of the indebtedness with the installment obligation.

     The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations–
    (1) disallowing the use of the installment method in whole or in part for transactions in which the rules of this section otherwise would be avoided through the use of related persons, pass-thru entities, or intermediaries, and
    (2) providing that the sale of an interest in a partnership or other pass-thru entity will be treated as a sale of the proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or other entity.
