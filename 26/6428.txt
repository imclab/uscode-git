     In the case of an eligible individual, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the taxpayer“s first taxable year beginning in 2001 an amount equal to 5 percent of so much of the taxpayer“s taxable income as does not exceed the initial bracket amount (as defined in section 1(i)(1)(B)).
  (b) Credit treated as nonrefundable personal credit
     For purposes of this title, the credit allowed under this section shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1.

    (2) Advance refund amount
       For purposes of paragraph (1), the advance refund amount is the amount that would have been allowed as a credit under this section for such first taxable year if–

        (i) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over
        (ii) the sum of the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 (other than the credits allowable under subpart C thereof, relating to refundable credits).
    (3) Timing of payments
