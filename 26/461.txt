        (ii) the providing of property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as the person provides such property, or
        (iii) the use of property by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer uses such property.

          (I) such item is not a material item, or
          (II) the accrual of such item in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met results in a more proper match against income than accruing such item in the taxable year in which economic performance occurs.
