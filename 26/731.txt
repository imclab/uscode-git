        (iii) such partnership is an investment partnership and such partner is an eligible partner thereof.
      (B) Limitation on gain recognized
         In the case of a distribution of marketable securities to a partner, the amount taken into account under paragraph (1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the excess (if any) of–
