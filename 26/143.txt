    (3) 5 percent test for private business use not related or disproportionate to government use financed by the issue
      (A) In general
         An issue shall be treated as meeting the tests of paragraphs (1) and (2) if such tests would be met if such paragraphs were applied–
        (i) by substituting ””5 percent““ for ””10 percent““ each place it appears, and
        (ii) by taking into account only–

       If the nonqualified amount with respect to an issue–
      (A) exceeds $15,000,000, but
      (B) does not exceed the amount which would cause a bond which is part of such issue to be treated as a private activity bond without regard to this paragraph,
       such bond shall nonetheless be treated as a private activity bond unless the issuer allocates a portion of its volume cap under section 146 to such issue in an amount equal to the excess of such nonqualified amount over $15,000,000.
