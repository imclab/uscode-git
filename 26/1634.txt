      (A) any plans or designs for such renovation or modernization; and

  (b) Requirements
     The requirements of this subsection are met with respect to any renovation or modernization if–
    (1) the tribe or tribal organization–
      (A) provides notice to the Secretary of its intent to renovate or modernize; and
      (B) applies to the Secretary to be placed on a separate priority list to address the needs of such new facilities for personnel or equipment; and
