  (b) Excess parachute payment
     For purposes of this section–
    (1) In general
       The term ””excess parachute payment““ means an amount equal to the excess of any parachute payment over the portion of the base amount allocated to such payment.
    (2) Parachute payment defined
      (A) In general
         The term ””parachute payment““ means any payment in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual if–
        (i) such payment is contingent on a change–
          (I) in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or
          (II) in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, and
        (ii) the aggregate present value of the payments in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) such individual which are contingent on such change equals or exceeds an amount equal to 3 times the base amount.
         For purposes of clause (ii), payments not treated as parachute payments under paragraph (4)(A), (5), or (6) shall not be taken into account.
      (B) Agreements
         The term ””parachute payment““ shall also include any payment in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual if such payment is made pursuant to an agreement which violates any generally enforced securities laws or regulations. In any proceeding involving the issue of whether any payment made to a disqualified individual is a parachute payment on account of a violation of any generally enforced securities laws or regulations, the burden of proof with respect to establishing the occurrence of a violation of such a law or regulation shall be upon the Secretary.
      (C) Treatment of certain agreements entered into within 1 year before change of ownership
         For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), any payment pursuant to–
        (i) an agreement entered into within 1 year before the change described in subparagraph (A)(i), or
        (ii) an amendment made within such 1-year period of a previous agreement,
         shall be presumed to be contingent on such change unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence.
    (3) Base amount
      (A) In general
         The term ””base amount““ means the individual“s annualized includible compensation for the base period.
      (B) Allocation
         The portion of the base amount allocated to any parachute payment shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the base amount as–
        (i) the present value of such payment, bears to
        (ii) the aggregate present value of all such payments.
    (4) Treatment of amounts which taxpayer establishes as reasonable compensation
       In the case of any payment described in paragraph (2)(A)–
      (A) the amount treated as a parachute payment shall not include the portion of such payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), and
      (B) the amount treated as an excess parachute payment shall be reduced by the portion of such payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i).
       For purposes of subparagraph (B), reasonable compensation for services actually rendered before the date of the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i) shall be first offset against the base amount.
    (5) Exemption for small business corporations, etc.
      (A) In general
         Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the term ””parachute payment““ does not include–
        (i) any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation which (immediately before the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i)) was a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361(b) but without regard to paragraph (1)(C) thereof), and
        (ii) any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation (other than a corporation described in clause (i)) if–
          (I) immediately before the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), no stock in such corporation was readily tradeable on an established securities market or otherwise, and
          (II) the shareholder approval requirements of subparagraph (B) are met with respect to such payment.
         The Secretary may, by regulations, prescribe that the requirements of subclause (I) of clause (ii) are not met where a substantial portion of the assets of any entity consists (directly or indirectly) of stock in such corporation and interests in such other entity are readily tradeable on an established securities market, or otherwise. Stock described in section 1504(a)(4) shall not be taken into account under clause (ii)(I) if the payment does not adversely affect the shareholder“s redemption and liquidation rights.
      (B) Shareholder approval requirements
         The shareholder approval requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any payment if–
        (i) such payment was approved by a vote of the persons who owned, immediately before the change described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), more than 75 percent of the voting power of all outstanding stock of the corporation, and
        (ii) there was adequate disclosure to shareholders of all material facts concerning all payments which (but for this paragraph) would be parachute payments with respect to a disqualified individual.
         The regulations prescribed under subsection (e) shall include regulations providing for the application of this subparagraph in the case of shareholders which are not individuals (including the treatment of nonvoting interests in an entity which is a shareholder) and where an entity holds a de minimis amount of stock in the corporation.
