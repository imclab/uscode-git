    (1) fire, flood, casualty, or other disaster, or
    (2) breakage, destruction, or other damage (but not including theft) resulting from vandalism or malicious mischief,
       if such disaster or damage occurred in the United States and if such distilled spirits, wines, or beer were held and intended for sale at the time of such disaster or other damage.

       No claim shall be allowed under this section unless–
      (A) filed within 6 months after the date on which such distilled spirits, wines, or beer were lost, rendered unmarketable, or condemned by a duly authorized official, and
      (B) the claimant furnishes proof satisfactory to the Secretary that the claimant–
        (i) was not indemnified by any valid claim of insurance or otherwise in respect of the tax, or tax and duty, on the distilled spirits, wines, or beer covered by the claim; and
        (ii) is entitled to payment under this section.

       If the President has determined under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act that a ””major disaster““ (as defined in such Act) has occurred in any part of the United States, and if the disaster referred to in subsection (a)(1) occurs in such part of the United States by reason of such major disaster, then–
      (A) paragraph (2) shall not apply, and
      (B) the filing period set forth in paragraph (1)(A) shall not expire before the day which is 6 months after the date on which the President makes the determination that such major disaster has occurred.
    (4) Regulations

     All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable in respect of internal revenue taxes on distilled spirits, wines, and beer shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with this section, be applied in respect of the payments provided for in this section to the same extent as if such payments constituted refunds of such taxes.
