  (a) Amount of deduction
     In the case of a public utility, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed as follows:
    (1) First determine the amount which is the lesser of–
      (A) the amount of dividends paid during the taxable year on its preferred stock, or
      (B) the taxable income for the taxable year (computed without the deduction allowed by this section).
    (2) Then multiply the amount determined under paragraph (1) by the fraction–
      (A) the numerator of which is 14 percent, and
      (B) the denominator of which is that percentage which equals the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).
         For purposes of the deduction provided in this section, the amount of dividends paid shall not include any amount distributed in the current taxable year with respect to dividends unpaid and accumulated in any taxable year ending before October 1, 1942. Amounts distributed in the current taxable year with respect to dividends unpaid and accumulated for a prior taxable year shall for purposes of this subsection be deemed to be distributed with respect to the earliest year or years for which there are dividends unpaid and accumulated.
