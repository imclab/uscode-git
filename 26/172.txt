  (a) General rule
     In the case of any bond, as defined in subsection (d), the following rules shall apply to the amortizable bond premium (determined under subsection (b)) on the bond:
    (1) Taxable bonds
       In the case of a bond (other than a bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income), the amount of the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction.
    (2) Tax-exempt bonds
       In the case of any bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income, no deduction shall be allowed for the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year.
    (3) Cross reference
       T2For adjustment to basis on account of amortizable bond premium, see section 1016(a)(5).
  (b) Amortizable bond premium
    (1) Amount of bond premium
       For purposes of paragraph (2), the amount of bond premium, in the case of the holder of any bond, shall be determined–
      (A) with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond,
      (B)        (i) with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date, in the case of any bond other than a bond to which clause (ii) applies, or and \1\N
        (ii) with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium attributable to the period to earlier call date, with reference to the amount payable on earlier call date), in the case of any bond described in subsection (a)(1) which is acquired after December 31, 1957, and
      (C) with adjustments proper to reflect unamortized bond premium, with respect to the bond, for the period before the date as of which subsection (a) becomes applicable with respect to the taxpayer with respect to such bond.
       In no case shall the amount of bond premium on a convertible bond include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.
    (2) Amount amortizable
       The amortizable bond premium of the taxable year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such year. In the case of a bond to which paragraph (1)(B)(ii) applies and which has a call date, the amount of bond premium attributable to the taxable year in which the bond is called shall include an amount equal to the excess of the amount of the adjusted basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond as of the beginning of the taxable year over the amount received on redemption of the bond or (if greater) the amount payable on maturity.
    (3) Method of determination
      (A) In general
         Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the determinations required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made on the basis of the taxpayer“s yield to maturity determined by–
        (i) using the taxpayer“s basis (for purposes of determining loss on sale or exchange) of the obligation, and
        (ii) compounding at the close of each accrual period (as defined in section 1272(a)(5)).
      (B) Special rule where earlier call date is used
         For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the amount payable on an earlier call date is used under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) in determining the amortizable bond premium attributable to the period before the earlier call date, such bond shall be treated as maturing on such date for the amount so payable and then reissued on such date for the amount so payable.
    (4) Treatment of certain bonds acquired in exchange for other property
      (A) In general
         If–
        (i) a bond is acquired by any person in exchange for other property, and
        (ii) the basis of such bond is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such other property,
         for purposes of applying this subsection to such bond while held by such person, the basis of such bond shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the exchange. A similar rule shall apply in the case of such bond while held by any other person whose basis is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis in the hands of the person referred to in clause (i).
      (B) Special rule where bond exchanged in reorganization
         Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an exchange by the taxpayer of a bond for another bond if such exchange is a part of a reorganization (as defined in section 368). If any portion of the basis of the taxpayer in a bond transferred in such an exchange is not taken into account in determining bond premium by reason of this paragraph, such portion shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of bond premium on any bond received in the exchange.
  (c) Election as to taxable bonds
    (1) Eligibility to elect; bonds with respect to which election permitted
       In the case of bonds the interest on which is not excludible from gross income, this section shall apply only if the taxpayer has so elected.
    (2) Manner and effect of election
       The election authorized under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe. If such election is made with respect to any bond (described in paragraph (1)) of the taxpayer, it shall also apply to all such bonds held by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by him and shall be binding for all subsequent taxable years with respect to all such bonds of the taxpayer, unless, on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary permits him, subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to revoke such election. In the case of bonds held by a common trust fund, as defined in section 584(a), the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the common trust fund. In case of bonds held by an estate or trust, the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the fiduciary.
  (d) Bond defined
     For purposes of this section, the term ””bond““ means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, but does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or any such obligation held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
  (e) Treatment as offset to interest payments
     Except as provided in regulations, in the case of any taxable bond–
    (1) the amount of any bond premium shall be allocated among the interest payments on the bond under rules similar to the rules of subsection (b)(3), and
    (2) in lieu of any deduction under subsection (a), the amount of any premium so allocated to any interest payment shall be applied against (and operate to reduce) the amount of such interest payment.
       For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ””taxable bond““ means any bond the interest of which is not excludable from gross income.
  (f) Dealers in tax-exempt securities
     T2For special rules applicable, in the case of dealers in securities, with respect to premium attributable to certain wholly tax-exempt securities, see section 75.
