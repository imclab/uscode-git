  (a) Initial tax
     There is hereby imposed on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period), a tax equal to 15 percent of the amount of such income remaining undistributed at the beginning of such second (or succeeding) taxable year. The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation–
    (1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or
    (2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if–
      (A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,
      (B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),
      (C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and
      (D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.
  (b) Additional tax
     In any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, if any portion of such income remains undistributed at the close of the taxable period, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at such time.
  (c) Undistributed income
     For purposes of this section, the term ””undistributed income““ means, with respect to any private foundation for any taxable year as of any time, the amount by which–
    (1) the distributable amount for such taxable year, exceeds
    (2) the qualifying distributions made before such time out of such distributable amount.
  (d) Distributable amount
     For purposes of this section, the term ””distributable amount““ means, with respect to any foundation for any taxable year, an amount equal to–
    (1) the sum of the minimum investment return plus the amounts described in subsection (f)(2)(C), reduced by
    (2) the sum of the taxes imposed on such private foundation for the taxable year under subtitle A and section 4940.
  (e) Minimum investment return
    (1) In general
       For purposes of subsection (d), the minimum investment return for any private foundation for any taxable year is 5 percent of the excess of–
      (A) the aggregate fair market value of all assets of the foundation other than those which are used (or held for use) directly in carrying out the foundation“s exempt purpose, over
      (B) the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such assets (determined under section 514(c)(1) without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred).
    (2) Valuation
      (A) In general
         For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the fair market value of securities for which market quotations are readily available shall be determined on a monthly basis. For all other assets, the fair market value shall be determined at such times and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.
      (B) Reductions in value for blockage or similar factors
         In determining the value of any securities under this paragraph, the fair market value of such securities (determined without regard to any reduction in value) shall not be reduced unless, and only to the extent that, the private foundation establishes that as a result of–
        (i) the size of the block of such securities,
        (ii) the fact that the securities held are securities in a closely held corporation, or
        (iii) the fact that the sale of such securities would result in a forced or distress sale,
         the securities could not be liquidated within a reasonable period of time except at a price less than such fair market value. Any reduction in value allowable under this subparagraph shall not exceed 10 percent of such fair market value.
  (f) Adjusted net income
    (1) Defined
       For purposes of subsection (j), the term ””adjusted net income““ means the excess (if any) of–
      (A) the gross income for the taxable year (determined with the income modifications provided by paragraph (2)), over

    (2) Income modifications
       The income modifications referred to in paragraph (1)(A) are as follows:
      (A) section 103 (relating to State and local bonds) shall not apply,

        (i) amounts received or accrued as repayments of amounts which were taken into account as a qualifying distribution within the meaning of subsection (g)(1)(A) for any taxable year;
        (ii) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), amounts received or accrued from the sale or other disposition of property to the extent that the acquisition of such property was taken into account as a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of subsection (g)(1)(B)) for any taxable year; and

      (A) no deduction shall be allowed other than all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the production or collection of gross income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of such income and the allowances for depreciation and depletion determined under section 4940(c)(3)(B), and
      (B) section 265 (relating to expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt interest) shall not apply.

      (B) any amount paid to acquire an asset used (or held for use) directly in carrying out one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B).

      (A) In general
         For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1975, subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, an amount set aside for a specific project which comes within one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) may be treated as a qualifying distribution if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (B).
      (B) Requirements
         An amount set aside for a specific project shall meet the requirements of this subparagraph if at the time of the set-aside the foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the amount will be paid for the specific project within 5 years, and either–
        (i) at the time of the set-aside the private foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the project is one which can better be accomplished by such set-aside than by immediate payment of funds, or
        (ii)          (I) the project will not be completed before the end of the taxable year of the foundation in which the set-aside is made,
          (II) the private foundation in each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975 (or after the end of the fourth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later), distributes amounts, in cash or its equivalent, equal to not less than the distributable amount determined under subsection (d) (without regard to subsection (i)) for purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years), and
          (III) the private foundation has distributed (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years) during the four taxable years immediately preceding its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, or the fifth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later, an aggregate amount, in cash or its equivalent, of not less than the sum of the following: 80 percent of the first preceding taxable year“s distributable amount; 60 percent of the second preceding taxable year“s distributable amount; 40 percent of the third preceding taxable year“s distributable amount; and 20 percent of the fourth preceding taxable year“s distributable amount.

        (i) the failure to distribute such amounts was not willful and was due to reasonable cause, and
        (ii) the foundation distributes an amount in cash or its equivalent which is not less than the difference between the amounts required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) and the amounts actually distributed in cash or its equivalent during that taxable year within the correction period (as defined in section 4963(e)),
         such distribution in cash or its equivalent shall be treated for the purposes of this subparagraph as made during such year.
      (D) Reduction in distribution amount
         If, during the taxable years in the adjustment period for which the organization is a private foundation, the foundation distributes amounts in cash or its equivalent which exceed the amount required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in prior years), then for purposes of this subsection the distribution required under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess.
      (E) Adjustment period
         For purposes of subparagraph (D), with respect to any taxable year of a private foundation, the taxable years in the adjustment period are the taxable years (not exceeding 5) beginning after December 31, 1975, and immediately preceding the taxable year.

       For purposes of this section, the term ””qualifying distribution““ includes a contribution to a section 501(c)(3) organization described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii) if–
      (A) not later than the close of the first taxable year after its taxable year in which such contribution is received, such organization makes a distribution equal to the amount of such contribution and such distribution is a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of paragraph (1) or (2), without regard to this paragraph) which is treated under subsection (h) as a distribution out of corpus (or would be so treated if such section 501(c)(3) organization were a private foundation which is not an operating foundation), and
      (B) the private foundation making the contribution obtains adequate records or other sufficient evidence from such organization showing that the qualifying distribution described in subparagraph (A) has been made by such organization.

      (A) In general
         The amount of the grant administrative expenses paid during any taxable year which may be taken into account as qualifying distributions shall not exceed the excess (if any) of–

        (ii) the aggregate amount of grant administrative expenses paid during the 2 preceding taxable years which were taken into account as qualifying distributions.
      (B) Grant administrative expenses
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””grant administrative expenses““ means any administrative expenses which are allocable to the making of qualified grants.
      (C) Qualified grants

      (D) Net asset
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””net assets““ means, with respect to any taxable year, the excess determined under subsection (e)(1) for such taxable year.
      (E) Transitional rule

      (F) Termination
         This paragraph shall not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1990.

      (B) second out of the undistributed income for the taxable year to the extent thereof, and
      (C) then out of corpus.
       For purposes of this paragraph, distributions shall be taken into account in the order of time in which made.
    (2) Correction of deficient distributions for prior taxable years, etc.
       In the case of any qualifying distribution which (under paragraph (1)) is not treated as made out of the undistributed income of the immediately preceding taxable year, the foundation may elect to treat any portion of such distribution as made out of the undistributed income of a designated prior taxable year or out of corpus. The election shall be made by the foundation at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.
      (i) Adjustment of distributable amount where distributions during prior years have exceeded income
        (1) In general
           If, for the taxable years in the adjustment period for which an organization is a private foundation–
          (A) the aggregate qualifying distributions treated (under subsection (h)) as made out of the undistributed income for such taxable year or as made out of corpus (except to the extent subsection (g)(3) with respect to the recipient private foundation or section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) applies) during such taxable years, exceed
          (B) the distributable amounts for such taxable years (determined without regard to this subsection),
           then, for purposes of this section (other than subsection (h)), the distributable amount for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess.
        (2) Taxable years in adjustment period
           For purposes of paragraph (1), with respect to any taxable year of a private foundation the taxable years in the adjustment period are the taxable years (not exceeding 5) beginning after December 31, 1969, and immediately preceding the taxable year.
