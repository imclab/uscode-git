       In the case of the sale or other disposition of real property described in section 1221(a)(1), gross income shall not be reduced by inventory costs.
  (e) Inadvertent terminations
     If–
    (1) a partnership fails to meet the gross income requirements of subsection (c)(2),

  (g) Exception for electing 1987 partnerships
    (1) In general
       Subsection (a) shall not apply to an electing 1987 partnership.
    (2) Electing 1987 partnership
       For purposes of this subsection, the term ””electing 1987 partnership““ means any publicly traded partnership if–
      (A) such partnership is an existing partnership (as defined in section 10211(c)(2) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1987),
      (B) subsection (a) has not applied (and without regard to subsection (c)(1) would not have applied) to such partnership for all prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1987, and before January 1, 1998, and
      (C) such partnership elects the application of this subsection, and consents to the application of the tax imposed by paragraph (3), for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1997.
       A partnership which, but for this sentence, would be treated as an electing 1987 partnership shall cease to be so treated (and the election under subparagraph (C) shall cease to be in effect) as of the 1st day after December 31, 1997, on which there has been an addition of a substantial new line of business with respect to such partnership.
    (3) Additional tax on electing partnerships
      (A) Imposition of tax
         There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the income of each electing 1987 partnership a tax equal to 3.5 percent of such partnership“s gross income for the taxable year from the active conduct of trades and businesses by the partnership.
      (B) Adjustments in the case of tiered partnerships
         For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a partnership which is a partner in another partnership, the gross income referred to in subparagraph (A) shall include the partnership“s distributive share of the gross income of such other partnership from the active conduct of trades and businesses of such other partnership. A similar rule shall apply in the case of lower-tiered partnerships.
      (C) Treatment of tax
         For purposes of this title, the tax imposed by this paragraph shall be treated as imposed by chapter 1 other than for purposes of determining the amount of any credit allowable under chapter 1 and shall be paid by the partnership. Section 6655 shall be applied to such partnership with respect to such tax in the same manner as if the partnership were a corporation, such tax were imposed by section 11, and references in such section to taxable income were references to the gross income referred to in subparagraph (A).
    (4) Election
       An election and consent under this subsection shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked by the partnership. Such revocation may be made without the consent of the Secretary, but, once so revoked, may not be reinstated.
