   In the case of a minister of the gospel, gross income does not includeâ€“
  (1) the rental value of a home furnished to him as part of his compensation; or
  (2) the rental allowance paid to him as part of his compensation, to the extent used by him to rent or provide a home and to the extent such allowance does not exceed the fair rental value of the home, including furnishings and appurtenances such as a garage, plus the cost of utilities.
