        (iii) section 111(m) of CERCLA (as so in effect), or
      (B) hereafter authorized by a law which does not authorize the expenditure out of the Superfund for a general purpose not covered by subparagraph (A) (as so in effect).
    (2) Exception for certain transfers, etc., of hazardous substances
       No amount in the Superfund or derived from the Superfund shall be available or used for the transfer or disposal of hazardous waste carried out pursuant to a cooperative agreement between the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and a State if the following conditions apply–
      (A) the transfer or disposal, if made on December 13, 1985, would not comply with a State or local requirement,

    (1) In general
       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Superfund, as repayable advances, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Superfund.
    (2) Limitation on aggregate advances
       The maximum aggregate amount of repayable advances to the Superfund which is outstanding at any one time shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount which the Secretary estimates will be equal to the sum of the amounts appropriated to the Superfund under subsection (b)(1) during the following 24 months.
    (3) Repayment of advances
      (A) In general
         Advances made to the Superfund shall be repaid, and interest on such advances shall be paid, to the general fund of the Treasury when the Secretary determines that moneys are available for such purposes in the Superfund.

         No advance shall be made to the Superfund after December 31, 1995, and all advances to such Fund shall be repaid on or before such date.
      (C) Rate of interest
         Interest on advances made to the Superfund shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (as of the close of the calendar month preceding the month in which the advance is made) to be equal to the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the anticipated period during which the advance will be outstanding and shall be compounded annually.
  (e) Liability of United States limited to amount in Trust Fund
    (1) General rule
       Any claim filed against the Superfund may be paid only out of the Superfund.
    (2) Coordination with other provisions
       Nothing in CERCLA or the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (or in any amendment made by either of such Acts) shall authorize the payment by the United States Government of any amount with respect to any such claim out of any source other than the Superfund.
    (3) Order in which unpaid claims are to be paid
       If at any time the Superfund has insufficient funds to pay all of the claims payable out of the Superfund at such time, such claims shall, to the extent permitted under paragraph (1), be paid in full in the order in which they were finally determined.
