  (a) In eligibility to enroll
    (1) In general
       Subject to paragraph (2), a group health plan may not establish rules for eligibility (including continued eligibility) of any individual to enroll under the terms of the plan based on any of the following factors in relation to the individual or a dependent of the individual:
      (A) Health status.
      (B) Medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses).
      (C) Claims experience.
      (D) Receipt of health care.
      (E) Medical history.
      (F) Genetic information.
      (G) Evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence).
      (H) Disability.
    (2) No application to benefits or exclusions
       To the extent consistent with section 9801, paragraph (1) shall not be construed–
      (A) to require a group health plan to provide particular benefits (or benefits with respect to a specific procedure, treatment, or service) other than those provided under the terms of such plan; or
      (B) to prevent such a plan from establishing limitations or restrictions on the amount, level, extent, or nature of the benefits or coverage for similarly situated individuals enrolled in the plan or coverage.
    (3) Construction
       For purposes of paragraph (1), rules for eligibility to enroll under a plan include rules defining any applicable waiting periods for such enrollment.
  (b) In premium contributions
    (1) In general
       A group health plan may not require any individual (as a condition of enrollment or continued enrollment under the plan) to pay a premium or contribution which is greater than such premium or contribution for a similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan on the basis of any factor described in subsection (a)(1) in relation to the individual or to an individual enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual.
    (2) Construction
       Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed–
      (A) to restrict the amount that an employer may be charged for coverage under a group health plan; or
      (B) to prevent a group health plan from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.
  (c) Special rules for church plans
     A church plan (as defined in section 414(e)) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this section solely because such plan requires evidence of good health for coverage of–
    (1) both any employee of an employer with 10 or less employees (determined without regard to section 414(e)(3)(C)) and any self-employed individual, or
    (2) any individual who enrolls after the first 90 days of initial eligibility under the plan.
       This subsection shall apply to a plan for any year only if the plan included the provisions described in the preceding sentence on July 15, 1997, and at all times thereafter before the beginning of such year.
