   In developing the roll of Pembina descendants, the Secretary of the Interior shall determine which enrollees are members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewas of North Dakota, or the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of Montana, and subsequent to the establishment of the descendancy roll shall apportion funds to the three cited tribes on the basis of the numbers of descendants having membership with these tribes. Fund not apportioned in this manner shall be distributed in equal shares to those enrolled descendants who are not members of the three cited tribes.
