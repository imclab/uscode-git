  (a) Requirement of notice before levy
    (1) In general

  (b) Right to fair hearing
    (1) In general

       A person shall be entitled to only one hearing under this section with respect to the taxable period to which the unpaid tax specified in subsection (a)(3)(A) relates.

       The hearing under this subsection shall be conducted by an officer or employee who has had no prior involvement with respect to the unpaid tax specified in subsection (a)(3)(A) before the first hearing under this section or section 6320. A taxpayer may waive the requirement of this paragraph.

         The person may raise at the hearing any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy, including–
        (i) appropriate spousal defenses;
        (ii) challenges to the appropriateness of collection actions; and
        (iii) offers of collection alternatives, which may include the posting of a bond, the substitution of other assets, an installment agreement, or an offer-in-compromise.
      (B) Underlying liability
         The person may also raise at the hearing challenges to the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability for any tax period if the person did not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.

       The determination by an appeals officer under this subsection shall take into consideration–
      (A) the verification presented under paragraph (1);
      (B) the issues raised under paragraph (2); and

  (e) Suspension of collections and statute of limitations
    (1) In general
       Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a hearing is requested under subsection (a)(3)(B), the levy actions which are the subject of the requested hearing and the running of any period of limitations under section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment), section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions), or section 6532 (relating to other suits) shall be suspended for the period during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are pending. In no event shall any such period expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination in such hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the beginning of a levy or proceeding during the time the suspension under this paragraph is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction under this paragraph to enjoin any action or proceeding unless a timely appeal has been filed under subsection (d)(1) and then only in respect of the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination being appealed relates.
    (2) Levy upon appeal
       Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a levy action while an appeal is pending if the underlying tax liability is not at issue in the appeal and the court determines that the Secretary has shown good cause not to suspend the levy.
  (f) Jeopardy and State refund collection
     If–
    (1) the Secretary has made a finding under the last sentence of section 6331(a) that the collection of tax is in jeopardy,
    (2) the Secretary has served a levy on a State to collect a Federal tax liability from a State tax refund, or
    (3) the Secretary has served a disqualified employment tax levy,
       this section shall not apply, except that the taxpayer shall be given the opportunity for the hearing described in this section within a reasonable period of time after the levy.
  (g) Frivolous requests for hearing, etc.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Secretary determines that any portion of a request for a hearing under this section or section 6320 meets the requirement of clause (i) or (ii) of section 6702(b)(2)(A), then the Secretary may treat such portion as if it were never submitted and such portion shall not be subject to any further administrative or judicial review.
  (h) Disqualified employment tax levy
     For purposes of subsection (f), a disqualified employment tax levy is any levy in connection with the collection of employment taxes for any taxable period if the person subject to the levy (or any predecessor thereof) requested a hearing under this section with respect to unpaid employment taxes arising in the most recent 2-year period before the beginning of the taxable period with respect to which the levy is served. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ””employment taxes““ means any taxes under chapter 21, 22, 23, or 24.
