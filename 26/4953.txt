    (2) the amount determined under this subsection for the preceding taxable year, reduced by the sum of–
      (A) the excess of the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 192 for the taxable year over the amount contributed to the trust or trusts for the taxable year, and
      (B) amounts distributed from the trust to the contributor which were excess contributions for the preceding taxable year.
  (c) Treatment of withdrawal of excess contributions
     Amounts distributed during the taxable year from a trust described in section 501(c)(21) to the contributor thereof the sum of which does not exceed the amount of the excess contribution made by the contributor shall not be treated as–
    (1) an act of self-dealing (within the meaning of section 4951),
    (2) a taxable expenditure (within the meaning of section 4952), or
    (3) an act contrary to the purposes for which the trust is exempt from taxation under section 501(a).
