      (B) in the case of a qualified new energy efficient home which is a manufactured home, the manufactured home producer of such home.
    (2) Qualified new energy efficient home
       The term ””qualified new energy efficient home““ means a dwelling unit–
      (A) located in the United States,
      (B) the construction of which is substantially completed after the date of the enactment of this section, and
      (C) which meets the energy saving requirements of subsection (c).

  (c) Energy saving requirements
     A dwelling unit meets the energy saving requirements of this subsection if such unit is–
    (1) certified–
      (A) to have a level of annual heating and cooling energy consumption which is at least 50 percent below the annual level of heating and cooling energy consumption of a comparable dwelling unit–
        (i) which is constructed in accordance with the standards of chapter 4 of the 2003 International Energy Conservation Code, as such Code (including supplements) is in effect on the date of the enactment of this section, and
        (ii) for which the heating and cooling equipment efficiencies correspond to the minimum allowed under the regulations established by the Department of Energy pursuant to the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 and in effect at the time of completion of construction, and
      (B) to have building envelope component improvements account for at least \1/5\ of such 50 percent,
    (2) a manufactured home which conforms to Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (part 3280 of title 24, Code of Federal Regulations) and which meets the requirements of paragraph (1), or

    (2) Form
       Any certification described in subsection (c) shall be made in writing in a manner which specifies in readily verifiable fashion the energy efficient building envelope components and energy efficient heating or cooling equipment installed and their respective rated energy efficiency performance.
  (e) Basis adjustment
