      (B) the qualified heir ceases to use for the qualified use the qualified real property which was acquired (or passed) from the decedent,
       then, there is hereby imposed an additional estate tax.
    (2) Amount of additional tax

         The amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any interest shall be the amount equal to the lesser of–
        (i) the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest, or
        (ii) the excess of the amount realized with respect to the interest (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm“s length, the fair market value of the interest) over the value of the interest determined under subsection (a).
      (B) Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest
         For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjusted tax difference attributable to an interest is the amount which bears the same ratio to the adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate (determined under subparagraph (C)) as–
        (i) the excess of the value of such interest for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to subsection (a)) over the value of such interest determined under subsection (a), bears to

        (ii) the adjusted tax difference attributable to the interest taken into account with respect to the transaction involving the second or any succeeding portion shall be reduced by the amount of the tax imposed by this subsection with respect to all prior transactions involving portions of such interest.
      (E) Special rule for disposition of timber
         In the case of qualified woodland to which an election under subsection (e)(13)(A) applies, if the qualified heir disposes of (or severs) any standing timber on such qualified woodland–
        (i) such disposition (or severance) shall be treated as a disposition of a portion of the interest of the qualified heir in such property, and
        (ii) the amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to such disposition shall be an amount equal to the lesser of–
          (I) the amount realized on such disposition (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm“s length, the fair market value of the portion of the interest disposed or severed), or
          (II) the amount of additional tax determined under this paragraph (without regard to this subparagraph) if the entire interest of the qualified heir in the qualified woodland had been disposed of, less the sum of the amount of the additional tax imposed with respect to all prior transactions involving such woodland to which this subparagraph applied.

The amount of additional tax imposed under paragraph (1) in any case in which a qualified heir disposes of his entire interest in the qualified woodland shall be reduced by any amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to such woodland.
    (3) Only 1 additional tax imposed with respect to any 1 portion

       For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), real property shall cease to be used for the qualified use if–
      (A) such property ceases to be used for the qualified use set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(2) under which the property qualified under subsection (b), or
      (B) during any period of 8 years ending after the date of the decedent“s death and before the date of the death of the qualified heir, there had been periods aggregating more than 3 years during which–
        (i) in the case of periods during which the property was held by the decedent, there was no material participation by the decedent or any member of his family in the operation of the farm or other business, and
        (ii) in the case of periods during which the property was held by any qualified heir, there was no material participation by such qualified heir or any member of his family in the operation of the farm or other business.

    (8) Qualified conservation contribution is not a disposition

          (B) Exchanges where other property received
             If an interest in qualified real property is exchanged for an interest in qualified exchange property and other property in a transaction which qualifies under section 1031, the amount of the tax imposed by subsection (c) by reason of such exchange shall be the amount of tax which (but for this subparagraph) would have been imposed on such exchange under subsection (c)(1), reduced by an amount which–
            (i) bears the same ratio to such tax, as
            (ii) the fair market value of the qualified exchange property bears to the fair market value of the qualified real property exchanged.
             For purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, fair market value shall be determined as of the time of the exchange.

          (B) any tax imposed by subsection (c) by reason of the exchange shall be treated as a tax imposed on a partial disposition, and
          (C) paragraph (6) of subsection (c) shall be applied by treating material participation with respect to the exchanged property as material participation with respect to the qualified exchange property.
        (3) Qualified exchange property
           For purposes of this subsection, the term ””qualified exchange property““ means real property which is to be used for the qualified use set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(2) under which the real property exchanged therefor originally qualified under subsection (a).
