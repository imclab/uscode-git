  (c) Constructive sale
     For purposes of this section–

      (B) enters into an offsetting notional principal contract with respect to the same or substantially identical property,

    (3) Exception for certain closed transactions

        (ii) the taxpayer holds the appreciated financial position throughout the 60-day period beginning on the date such transaction is closed, and

        (ii) another transaction is entered into during the 60-day period beginning on the date the transaction referred to in clause (i) is closed–
          (I) which would (but for this subparagraph) cause the requirement of subparagraph (A)(iii) not to be met with respect to the transaction described in clause (i) of this subparagraph,
          (II) which is closed on or before the 30th day after the close of the taxable year in which the transaction referred to in clause (i) occurs, and
          (III) which meets the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A),
         the transaction referred to in clause (ii) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iii) are met with respect to the transaction described in clause (i).
    (4) Related person
       A person is related to another person with respect to a transaction if–
      (A) the relationship is described in section 267(b) or 707(b), and

  (e) Special rules
    (1) Treatment of subsequent sale of position which was deemed sold
       If–
      (A) there is a constructive sale of any appreciated financial position,
      (B) such position is subsequently disposed of, and
      (C) at the time of such disposition, the transaction resulting in the constructive sale of such position is open with respect to the taxpayer or any related person,
       solely for purposes of determining whether the taxpayer has entered into a constructive sale of any other appreciated financial position held by the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be treated as entering into such transaction immediately after such disposition. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an assignment or other termination shall be treated as a disposition.
    (2) Certain trust instruments treated as stock
