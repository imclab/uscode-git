  (a) Excess inclusions may not be offset by net operating losses
    (1) In general

    (2) Special rule for affiliated groups
       All members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return shall be treated as 1 taxpayer for purposes of this subsection.
    (3) Coordination with section 172

      (B) in determining taxable income for such taxable year for purposes of the 2nd sentence of section 172(b)(2).
    (4) Coordination with minimum tax
       For purposes of part VI of subchapter A of this chapter–
      (A) the reference in section 55(b)(2) to taxable income shall be treated as a reference to taxable income determined without regard to this subsection,

  (b) Organizations subject to unrelated business tax
     If the holder of any residual interest in a REMIC is an organization subject to the tax imposed by section 511, the excess inclusion of such holder for any taxable year shall be treated as unrelated business taxable income of such holder for purposes of section 511.
  (c) Excess inclusion
     For purposes of this section–
    (1) In general
       The term ””excess inclusion““ means, with respect to any residual interest in a REMIC for any calendar quarter, the excess (if any) of–
      (A) the amount taken into account with respect to such interest by the holder under section 860C(a), over
      (B) the sum of the daily accruals with respect to such interest for days during such calendar quarter while held by such holder.
       To the extent provided in regulations, if residual interests in a REMIC do not have significant value, the excess inclusions with respect to such interests shall be the amount determined under subparagraph (A) without regard to subparagraph (B).
    (2) Determination of daily accruals
      (A) In general
         For purposes of this subsection, the daily accrual with respect to any residual interest for any day in any calendar quarter shall be determined by allocating to each day in such quarter its ratable portion of the product of–
        (i) the adjusted issue price of such interest at the beginning of such quarter, and
        (ii) 120 percent of the long-term Federal rate (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each calendar quarter and properly adjusted for the length of such quarter).
      (B) Adjusted issue price
         For purposes of this paragraph, the adjusted issue price of any residual interest at the beginning of any calendar quarter is the issue price of the residual interest (adjusted for contributions)–
        (i) increased by the amount of daily accruals for prior quarters, and
        (ii) decreased (but not below zero) by any distribution made with respect to such interest before the beginning of such quarter.
      (C) Federal long-term rate
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””Federal long-term rate““ means the Federal long-term rate which would have applied to the residual interest under section 1274(d) (determined without regard to paragraph (2) thereof) if it were a debt instrument.

      (A) the aggregate excess inclusions determined with respect to such interests, over
      (B) the real estate investment trust taxable income (within the meaning of section 857(b)(2), excluding any net capital gain),
     shall be allocated among the shareholders of such trust in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders from such trust, and
    (2) any amount allocated to a shareholder under paragraph (1) shall be treated as an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest held by such shareholder.
       Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentence shall apply also in the case of regulated investment companies, common trust funds, and organizations to which part I of subchapter T applies.
  (e) Tax on transfers of residual interests to certain organizations, etc.
    (1) In general
       A tax is hereby imposed on any transfer of a residual interest in a REMIC to a disqualified organization.
    (2) Amount of tax
       The amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) on any transfer of a residual interest shall be equal to the product of–
      (A) the amount (determined under regulations) equal to the present value of the total anticipated excess inclusions with respect to such interest for periods after such transfer, multiplied by
      (B) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1).
    (3) Liability
       The tax imposed by paragraph (1) on any transfer shall be paid by the transferor; except that, where such transfer is through an agent for a disqualified organization, such tax shall be paid by such agent.
    (4) Transferee furnishes affidavit
       The person (otherwise liable for any tax imposed by paragraph (1)) shall be relieved of liability for the tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any transfer if–
      (A) the transferee furnishes to such person an affidavit that the transferee is not a disqualified organization, and

      (B) any organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from tax imposed by this chapter unless such organization is subject to the tax imposed by section 511, and
      (C) any organization described in section 1381(a)(2)(C).

    (6) Treatment of pass-thru entities
      (A) Imposition of tax
         If, at any time during any taxable year of a pass-thru entity, a disqualified organization is the record holder of an interest in such entity, there is hereby imposed on such entity for such taxable year a tax equal to the product of–
        (i) the amount of excess inclusions for such taxable year allocable to the interest held by such disqualified organization, multiplied by
        (ii) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1).
      (B) Pass-thru entity
         For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””pass-thru entity““ means–
        (i) any regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, or common trust fund,
        (ii) any partnership, trust, or estate, and
        (iii) any organization to which part I of subchapter T applies.
         Except as provided in regulations, a person holding an interest in a pass-thru entity as a nominee for another person shall, with respect to such interest, be treated as a pass-thru entity.
      (C) Tax to be deductible
         Any tax imposed by this paragraph with respect to any excess inclusion of any pass-thru entity for any taxable year shall, for purposes of this title (other than this subsection), be applied against (and operate to reduce) the amount included in gross income with respect to the residual interest involved.

      (B) there is paid to the Secretary such amounts as the Secretary may require.
    (8) Administrative provisions
