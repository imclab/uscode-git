   When preparing a Quileute tribal roll, the Secretary shall employ the criteria in article II of the approved constitution and bylaws of the Quileute Tribe of the Quileute Reservation, except that, in the absence of the 1935 census referred to in article II, section 1(a) of the constitution and bylaws, the Secretary, with the assistance of the governing body of the Quileute Tribe, shall construct a base roll from pertinent records, including other census data, of the same period. No person shall be eligible to have his name placed thereon if born after December 31, 1940. Upon approval of such base roll by the Secretary and the Quileute tribal governing body, it shall henceforth serve as the Quileute base roll for all purposes, the provisions of article II, section 1(a) notwithstanding.
