    (2) are consistent with information and data available to the Secretary; and
    (3) are not prohibited by or inconsistent with any provision of this chapter or other applicable law.
       If the Secretary determines that any of the appropriate certifications required under section 4112(c)(5) \1\N of this title are not included in the plan, the plan shall be deemed to be incomplete.
