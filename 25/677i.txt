   The tribal business committee representing the full-blood group, and the authorized representatives of the mixed-blood group, within sixty days after the publication of the final membership roll, as provided in section 677g of this title, shall commence a division of the assets of the tribe that are then susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution. Such division shall be by agreement between them subject to the approval of the Secretary. Said division shall be based upon the relative number of persons comprising the final membership roll of each group. After such division the rights or beneficial interests in tribal property of each mixed-blood person whose name appears on the roll shall constitute an undivided interest in and to such property which may be inherited or bequeathed, but shall be subject to alienation or encumbrance before the transfer of title to such tribal property only as provided herein. Any contract made in violation of this section shall be null and void. If said groups are unable to agree upon said division within a period of twelve months from the date of such commencement, or any authorized extension of said period granted within the discretion of the Secretary, the Secretary is authorized to partition the assets of the tribe in such manner as in his opinion will be equitable and fair to both groups. Such partition shall give rise to no cause of action against the United States and the costs of such partition shall be paid by the tribe. The Secretary is authorized to provide such reasonable assistance as may be requested by both groups, or by either group, in formulation and execution of a plan for the division of said assets, including necessary technical services of Government employees at Fort Duchesne, Utah, and arranging for necessary consultations with representatives of Federal departments and agencies, officials of the State of Utah, and political subdivisions thereof, and members of the tribe. All unadjudicated or unliquidated claims against the United States, all gas, oil, and mineral rights of every kind, and all other assets not susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution shall be managed jointly by the Tribal Business Committee and the authorized representatives of the mixed-blood group, subject to such supervision by the Secretary as is otherwise required by law, and the net proceeds therefrom after deducting the costs chargeable to such management shall first be divided between the full-blood and mixed-blood groups in direct proportion to the number of persons comprising the final membership roll of each group and without regard to the number of persons comprising each group at the time of the division of such proceeds.
   The stock of any corporation organized by the mixed-blood group for the purpose of empowering the officers of such corporation to act as the authorized representatives of said mixed-blood group in the joint management with the tribe and in the distribution and \1\N unadjudicated or unliquidated claims against the United States, all gas, oil, and mineral rights of every kind, and all other assets not susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution shall not be subject to mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, levy, execution, attachment or other similar process, while such stock remains in the ownership of the original stockholder or his heirs or legatees, but the interest of stockholders in any distribution by such corporation shall be subject to the usual processes of the law.
