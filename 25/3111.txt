      (G) an evaluation of the feasibility and desirability of establishing minimum standards against which the adequacy of the forestry programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in fulfilling its trust responsibility to Indian tribes can be measured, and
      (H) a recommendation of any reforms and increased funding levels necessary to bring Indian forest land management programs to a state-of-the-art condition.

  (b) Periodic assessments
     On each 10-year anniversary of November 28, 1990, the Secretary shall provide for an independent assessment of Indian forest lands and Indian forest land management practices under the criteria established in subsection (a) of this section which shall include analyses measured against findings in previous assessments.
