        (ii) in the case of a change or modification made to a prime contract that was entered into on or before October 13, 1994, and that has been modified pursuant to paragraph (6), the price adjustment is expected to exceed $500,000; and
        (iii) in the case of a change or modification not covered by clause (i) or (ii), the price adjustment is expected to exceed $100,000.
      (C) An offeror for a subcontract (at any tier) of a contract under this subchapter shall be required to submit cost or pricing data before the award of the subcontract if the prime contractor and each higher-tier subcontractor have been required to make available cost or pricing data under this section and–
        (i) in the case of a subcontract under a prime contract referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), the price of the subcontract is expected to exceed $500,000;
        (ii) in the case of a subcontract entered into under a prime contract that was entered into on or before October 13, 1994, and that has been modified pursuant to paragraph (6), the price of the subcontract is expected to exceed $500,000; and
        (iii) in the case of a subcontract not covered by clause (i) or (ii), the price of the subcontract is expected to exceed $100,000.
      (D) The subcontractor for a subcontract covered by subparagraph (C) shall be required to submit cost or pricing data before the pricing of a change or modification to the subcontract if–

    (2) A person required, as an offeror, contractor, or subcontractor, to submit cost or pricing data under paragraph (1) (or required by the head of the procuring activity concerned to submit such data under subsection (c) of this section) shall be required to certify that, to the best of the person“s knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data submitted are accurate, complete, and current.
    (3) Cost or pricing data required to be submitted under paragraph (1) (or under subsection (c) of this section), and a certification required to be submitted under paragraph (2), shall be submitted–
      (A) in the case of a submission by a prime contractor (or an offeror for a prime contract), to the contracting officer for the contract (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer); or
      (B) in the case of a submission by a subcontractor (or an offeror for a subcontract), to the prime contractor.

In the case of an amount that is evenly divisible by $25,000 but not evenly divisible by $50,000, the amount shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $50,000.
  (b) Exceptions
    (1) In general
       Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or subcontract–
      (A) for which the price agreed upon is based on–
        (i) adequate price competition; or
        (ii) prices set by law or regulation;
      (B) for the acquisition of a commercial item; or
      (C) in an exceptional case when the head of the procuring activity, without delegation, determines that the requirements of this section may be waived and justifies in writing the reasons for such determination.
    (2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items
       In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the exception to the submission of certified cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if–
      (A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of certified cost or pricing data may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B); and
      (B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.
  (c) Cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts
    (1) Authority to require submission
       Subject to paragraph (2), when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.
    (2) Exception
       The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Delegation of authority prohibited
       The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.
  (d) Submission of other information
    (1) Authority to require submission
       When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract. Except in the case of a contract or subcontract covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted include, at a minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the procurement.
    (2) Limitations on authority
       The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the following provisions regarding the types of information that contracting officers may require under paragraph (1):
      (A) Reasonable limitations on requests for sales data relating to commercial items.
      (B) A requirement that a contracting officer limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the scope of any request for information relating to commercial items from an offeror to only that information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.
      (C) A statement that any information received relating to commercial items that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.
  (e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data
    (1)      (A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.
      (B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.
    (2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.
    (3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that–
      (A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor–
        (i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or
        (ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;
      (B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;
      (C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or
      (D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.
    (4)      (A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if–
        (i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor“s knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and
        (ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.
      (B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if–
        (i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or
        (ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.
  (f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments
    (1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States–
      (A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed–
        (i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and
        (ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and
      (B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.
    (2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.
  (g) Right of United States to examine contractor records
     For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by section 254d(a)(2) of this title.
