   Appropriations made for printing and binding may not be used for an illustration, engraving, or photograph in a document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the order to print expressly authorizes it, nor in a document or report of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government until the head of the executive department or Government establishment certifies in a letter transmitting the report that the illustration, engraving, or photograph is necessary and relates entirely to the transaction of public business.
