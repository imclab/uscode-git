   An officer of the Government having machinery, material, equipment, or supplies for printing, binding, and blank-book work, including lithography, photolithography, and other processes of reproduction, no longer required or authorized for his service, shall submit a detailed report of them to the Public Printer. The Public Printer, with the approval of the Joint Committee on Printing, may requisition such articles as are serviceable in the Government Printing Office, and they shall be promptly delivered to that office.
