      (A) any information which is protected at all times by procedures established for information which has been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; or
      (B) any communication relating to a collection of information which is not approved under this chapter, the disclosure of which could lead to retaliation or discrimination against the communicator.
  (f)    (1) An independent regulatory agency which is administered by 2 or more members of a commission, board, or similar body, may by majority vote void–
      (A) any disapproval by the Director, in whole or in part, of a proposed collection of information of that agency; or
      (B) an exercise of authority under subsection (d) of section 3507 concerning that agency.
    (2) The agency shall certify each vote to void such disapproval or exercise to the Director, and explain the reasons for such vote. The Director shall without further delay assign a control number to such collection of information, and such vote to void the disapproval or exercise shall be valid for a period of 3 years.
  (g) The Director may not approve a collection of information for a period in excess of 3 years.

      (B) after having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the control number assigned by the Director for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this section, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.
    (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing rule, or recommends or instructs the agency to make a substantive or material change to a collection of information contained in an existing rule, the Director shall–
      (A) publish an explanation thereof in the Federal Register; and
      (B) instruct the agency to undertake a rulemaking within a reasonable time limited to consideration of changes to the collection of information contained in the rule and thereafter to submit the collection of information for approval or disapproval under this chapter.
    (3) An agency may not make a substantive or material modification to a collection of information after such collection has been approved by the Director, unless the modification has been submitted to the Director for review and approval under this chapter.
      (i)        (1) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency designated under section 3506(a) is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved and has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to such official the authority to approve proposed collections of information in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or for all agency purposes.
        (2) A delegation by the Director under this section shall not preclude the Director from reviewing individual collections of information if the Director determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.
      (j)        (1) The agency head may request the Director to authorize a collection of information, if an agency head determines that–
          (A) a collection of information–
            (i) is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this chapter; and
            (ii) is essential to the mission of the agency; and
          (B) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of this chapter because–
            (i) public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;
            (ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or
            (iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.
        (2) The Director shall approve or disapprove any such authorization request within the time requested by the agency head and, if approved, shall assign the collection of information a control number. Any collection of information conducted under this subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions of this chapter for a maximum of 180 days after the date on which the Director received the request to authorize such collection.
