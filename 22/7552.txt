   It is the sense of Congress thatâ€“
  (1) any United States physical protection force provided for the personal security of the President of Afghanistan should be composed of United States diplomatic security, law-enforcement, or military personnel, and should not utilize private contracted personnel to provide actual physical protection services;
  (2) United States allies should be invited to volunteer active-duty military or law enforcement personnel to participate in such a protection force; and
  (3) such a protection force should be limited in duration and should be succeeded by qualified Afghan security forces as soon as practicable.
