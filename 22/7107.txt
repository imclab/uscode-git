  (a) Statement of policy
     It is the policy of the United States not to provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance to any government that–
    (1) does not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; and
    (2) is not making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with such standards.
  (b) Reports to Congress
    (1) Annual report
       Not later than June 1 of each year, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report with respect to the status of severe forms of trafficking in persons that shall include–
      (A) a list of those countries, if any, to which the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking are applicable and whose governments fully comply with such standards;
      (B) a list of those countries, if any, to which the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking are applicable and whose governments do not yet fully comply with such standards but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance; and
      (C) a list of those countries, if any, to which the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking are applicable and whose governments do not fully comply with such standards and are not making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance.
    (2) Interim reports
       In addition to the annual report under paragraph (1), the Secretary of State may submit to the appropriate congressional committees at any time one or more interim reports with respect to the status of severe forms of trafficking in persons, including information about countries whose governments–
      (A) have come into or out of compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; or
      (B) have begun or ceased to make significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance,
       since the transmission of the last annual report.
    (3) Significant efforts
       In determinations under paragraph (1) or (2) as to whether the government of a country is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, the Secretary of State shall consider–
      (A) the extent to which the country is a country of origin, transit, or destination for severe forms of trafficking;
      (B) the extent of noncompliance with the minimum standards by the government and, particularly, the extent to which officials or employees of the government have participated in, facilitated, condoned, or are otherwise complicit in severe forms of trafficking; and
      (C) what measures are reasonable to bring the government into compliance with the minimum standards in light of the resources and capabilities of the government.
  (c) Notification
     Not less than 45 days or more than 90 days after the submission, on or after January 1, 2003, of an annual report under subsection (b)(1) of this section, or an interim report under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a notification of one of the determinations listed in subsection (d) of this section with respect to each foreign country whose government, according to such report–
    (A) does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; and
    (B) is not making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance, as described in subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section.
  (d) Presidential determinations
     The determinations referred to in subsection (c) of this section are the following:
    (1) Withholding of nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance
       The President has determined that–
      (A)        (i) the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance to the government of the country for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance; or
        (ii) in the case of a country whose government received no nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance from the United States during the previous fiscal year, the United States will not provide funding for participation by officials or employees of such governments in educational and cultural exchange programs for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance; and
      (B) the President will instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank and of the International Monetary Fund to vote against, and to use the Executive Director“s best efforts to deny, any loan or other utilization of the funds of the respective institution to that country (other than for humanitarian assistance, for trade-related assistance, or for development assistance which directly addresses basic human needs, is not administered by the government of the sanctioned country, and confers no benefit to that government) for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance.
    (2) Ongoing, multiple, broad-based restrictions on assistance in response to human rights violations
       The President has determined that such country is already subject to multiple, broad-based restrictions on assistance imposed in significant part in response to human rights abuses and such restrictions are ongoing and are comparable to the restrictions provided in paragraph (1). Such determination shall be accompanied by a description of the specific restriction or restrictions that were the basis for making such determination.
    (3) Subsequent compliance
       The Secretary of State has determined that the government of the country has come into compliance with the minimum standards or is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance.
    (4) Continuation of assistance in the national interest
       Notwithstanding the failure of the government of the country to comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and to make significant efforts to bring itself into compliance, the President has determined that the provision to the country of nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance, or the multilateral assistance described in paragraph (1)(B), or both, would promote the purposes of this chapter or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.
    (5) Exercise of waiver authority
      (A) In general
         The President may exercise the authority under paragraph (4) with respect to–
        (i) all nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance to a country;
        (ii) all multilateral assistance described in paragraph (1)(B) to a country; or
        (iii) one or more programs, projects, or activities of such assistance.
      (B) Avoidance of significant adverse effects
         The President shall exercise the authority under paragraph (4) when necessary to avoid significant adverse effects on vulnerable populations, including women and children.
