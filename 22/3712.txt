  (a) Termination of Panama Canal Commission Fund; unexpended balances covered into Panama Canal Revolving Fund
    (1) There is established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund to be known as the ””Panama Canal Revolving Fund““. The Panama Canal Revolving Fund shall, subject to subsection (c) of this section, be available to the Commission to carry out the purposes, functions, and powers authorized by this chapter, including for–
      (A) the hire of passenger motor vehicles and aircraft;
      (B) uniforms or allowances therefor, as authorized by sections 5901 and 5902 of title 5;
      (C) official receptions and representation expenses of the Board, the Secretary of the Commission, and the Administrator;
      (D) the operation of guide services;
      (E) a residence for the Administrator;
      (F) disbursements by the Administrator for employee and community projects; and
      (G) the procurement of expert and consultant services as provided in section 3109 of title 5.
    (2) On January 1, 1988–
      (A) the Panama Canal Commission Fund shall be terminated and the unappropriated balance, including undeposited receipts as of the close of business on the day before January 1, 1988, shall be transferred to the Panama Canal Revolving Fund;
      (B) the unexpended balance of appropriations to the Commission, as of the close of business on the day before January 1, 1988, shall be transferred to the Panama Canal Revolving Fund, and such amounts, including amounts appropriated for capital expenditures, shall remain available until expended;
      (C) the assets and liabilities recorded before January 1, 1988, under the ””Panama Canal Commission Fund““ shall be recorded under the Panama Canal Revolving Fund; and
      (D) the Panama Canal Emergency Fund shall be terminated and the remaining balance shall be transferred to the Panama Canal Revolving Fund.
  (b) Interest and nonreimbursed appropriations deposited into Treasury
     Upon completion of the transfers of funds under subsection (a) of this section–
    (1) amounts attributable to interest on the investment of the United States in the Panama Canal which accrued before January 1, 1986, shall be transferred from the Panama Canal Revolving Fund to the general fund of the Treasury; and
    (2) such amounts as were appropriated to the Commission in the fiscal year which ended September 30, 1980, and for which the Commission has not reimbursed the general fund of the Treasury, shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.
  (c) Tolls and other receipts into Panama Canal Revolving Fund; restriction on use of funds
    (1) There shall be deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund, on a continuing basis, toll receipts (other than amounts of toll receipts deposited into the Panama Canal Commission Dissolution Fund under section 3714a of this title) and all other receipts of the Commission. Except as provided in section 3713 of this title and subject to paragraph (2), no funds may be obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year unless such obligation or expenditure has been specifically authorized by law.
    (2) No funds may be obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year for administrative expenses except to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts.
    (3) No funds may be authorized for the use of the Commission, or obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year in excess of–
      (A) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund and the Panama Canal Dissolution Fund during such fiscal year, plus
      (B) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund before such fiscal year and remaining unexpended at the beginning of such fiscal year.
         Not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the Congress the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund during such fiscal year.
  (d) Authority of Commission to make deposits
     With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commission may deposit amounts in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund in any Federal Reserve bank, any depository for public funds, or in such other places and in such manner as the Commission and the Secretary may agree.
  (e) Review of annual budget
     The Committee on Appropriations of each House of Congress shall review the annual budget of the Commission, including operations and capital expenditures.
  (f) Costs of implementation
    (1) It is the sense of the Congress that the additional costs resulting from implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements should be kept to the absolute minimum level. To this end, the Congress declares that the direct appropriated costs of implementation to be borne by the taxpayers over the life of such Treaty should be kept to a level no greater than the March 1979 estimate of those costs ($870,700,000) presented to the Congress by the executive branch during consideration of this chapter by the Congress, less personnel retirement costs of $205,000,000, which were subtracted and charged to tolls, therefore resulting in the net taxpayer cost of approximately $665,700,000, plus appropriate adjustment for inflation.
    (2) It is further the sense of the Congress that the actual costs of implementation be consistent with the obligations of the United States to operate the Panama Canal safely and efficiently and keep it secure.
