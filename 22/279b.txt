   In adopting this subchapter, it is the sense of the Congress that the Government of the United States should use its best efforts to bring about, as soon as practicable, the integration of the functions and the resources of the International Institute of Agriculture with those of the Organization, in a legal and orderly manner, to effect one united institution in such form as to provide an adequate research, informational, and statistical service for the industry of agriculture.
