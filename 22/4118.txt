     If the Department has received from any individual a written assignment which authorizes the Department to deduct from the salary of that individual amounts for the payment of regular and periodic dues of the exclusive representative, the Department shall honor the assignment. Any such assignment shall be made at no cost to the exclusive representative or the individual. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of one year from its execution.

     An assignment for deduction of dues shall terminate whenâ€“

    (2) the individual ceases to receive a salary from the Department as a member of the Service; or
    (3) the individual is suspended or expelled from membership in the exclusive representative.
  (c) Negotiations with uncertified labor organizations

Negotiations under this subsection shall be concerned solely with the deduction of dues of the labor organization from the salary of the individuals who are members of the labor organization and who make a voluntary allotment for that purpose.
