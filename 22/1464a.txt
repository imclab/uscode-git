    (1) USIA–TV will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. USIA–TV news will be accurate and objective.
    (2) USIA–TV will represent the United States, not any single segment of American society and will, therefore, present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.

    (1) are interactive, consisting of interviews among participants in different locales;
    (2) cover news, public affairs, or other current events;
    (3) cover official activities of government, Federal or State, including congressional proceedings and news briefings of any agency of the Executive branch; or
    (4) are of an artistic or scientific character or are otherwise representative of American culture.
  (d) Costs
     When a comparable program produced by United States public or commercial broadcasters and producers is available at a cost which is equal to or less than the cost of production by USIA–TV, the Director of the United States Information Agency shall use such materials in preference to USIA–TV produced materials.
  (e) Allocation of funds
    (1) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the United States Information Agency not more than $12,000,000 for the fiscal year 1990 and not more than $12,480,000 for the fiscal year 1991 may be obligated or expended for USIA–TV.

Such reports shall contain specific justification and supporting information pertaining to all programs, particularly those described in subsection (c)(4) of this section, that were produced in-house by USIA–TV. Each such report shall include a statement by the Director of the United States Information Agency that, according to the best information available to the United States Information Agency, no comparable United States commercially-produced or public television program is available at a cost which is equal to or less than the cost of production by USIA–TV.
    (3) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the United States Information Agency, $1,500,000 for the fiscal year 1990 and $1,500,000 for the fiscal year 1991 shall be available only for the purchase or use of programs produced with grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or produced by United States public broadcasters.
