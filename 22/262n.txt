   The Congress hereby finds the following:
  (1) The financing of certain programs and projects by multilateral development banks has been of great concern insofar as the programs and projects have been detrimental to the interests of American farmers and the agribusiness sector.
  (2) An increase in rural income in developing countries will generally result in an increase in exports of United States agricultural and food products.
