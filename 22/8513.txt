The member countries of the Financial Action Task Force include the United States, Canada, most countries in western Europe, Russia, the People“s Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil.
    (3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its mandate to include addressing ””new and emerging threats such as proliferation financing““, meaning the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published ””guidance papers““ for members to assist them in implementing various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal specifically with proliferation by Iran.
    (4) The Financial Action Task Force has repeatedly called on members–
      (A) to advise financial institutions in their jurisdictions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with Iran, including Iranian companies and financial institutions;
