    (1) a grant is made under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (commonly known as the Fulbright-Hays Act) [22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.] or any statute which expressly authorizes or requires that a grant be made with a specified entity;
    (2) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;
    (3) a recipient organization has developed particular expertise in the planning and administration of longstanding exchange programs important to United States foreign policy; or
