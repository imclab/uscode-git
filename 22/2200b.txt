  (a) Requirement for certification
    (1) In general
       Except as provided in paragraph (3), the investor on whose behalf insurance, reinsurance, guaranties, or other financing is provided under this subpart with respect to a project shall be required to certify to the Corporation that any contract for the export of goods as part of that project will include a clause requiring that United States insurance companies have a fair and open competitive opportunity to provide insurance against risk of loss of such export.
    (2) When certification must be made
       The investor shall be required, in every practicable case, to so certify before the insurance, reinsurance, guarantee, or other financing is provided. In any case in which such a certification is not made in advance, the investor shall include in the certification the reasons for the failure to make a certification in advance.
    (3) Exception
       Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to an investor who does not, because of the nature of the investment, have a controlling interest in fact in the project in question.
