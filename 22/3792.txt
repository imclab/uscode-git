Tolls shall not be prescribed at rates calculated to produce revenues sufficient to cover payments to the Republic of Panama pursuant to paragraph 4(c) of Article XIII of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.
  (c) Payment of tolls by vessels of United States
     Vessels operated by the United States, including vessels of war and auxiliary vessels, and ocean-going training ships owned by the United States and operated by State nautical schools, shall pay tolls.
