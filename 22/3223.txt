  (a) Development of international approaches for meeting future worldwide nuclear fuel needs; international nuclear fuel authority
     Consistent with section 3224 of this title, the President shall institute prompt discussions with other nations and groups of nations, including both supplier and recipient nations, to develop international approaches for meeting future worldwide nuclear fuel needs. In particular, the President is authorized and urged to seek to negotiate as soon as practicable with nations possessing nuclear fuel production facilities or source material, and such other nations and groups of nations, such as the IAEA, as may be deemed appropriate, with a view toward the timely establishment of binding international undertakings providing forâ€“
    (1) the establishment of an international nuclear fuel authority (INFA) with responsibility for providing agreed upon fuel services and allocating agreed upon quantities of fuel resources to ensure fuel supply on reasonable terms in accordance with agreements between INFA and supplier and recipient nations;
    (2) a set of conditions consistent with subsection (d) of this section under which international fuel assurances under INFA auspices will be provided to recipient nations, including conditions which will ensure that the transferred materials will not be used for nuclear explosive devices;
    (3) devising, consistent with the policy goals set forth in section 2153b of title 42, feasible and environmentally sound approaches for the siting, development, and management under effective international auspices and inspection of facilities for the provision of nuclear fuel services, including the storage of special nuclear material;
    (4) the establishment of repositories for the storage of spent nuclear reactor fuel under effective international auspices and inspection;
    (5) the establishment of arrangements under which nations placing spent fuel in such repositories would receive appropriate compensation for the energy content of such spent fuel if recovery of such energy content is deemed necessary or desirable; and
    (6) sanctions for violation of the provisions of or for abrogation of such binding international undertakings.
  (b) (c) Omitted
  (d) Adherence of nations to policies designed to prevent proliferation
     The fuel assurances contemplated by this section shall be for the benefit of nations that adhere to policies designed to prevent proliferation. In negotiating the binding international undertakings called for in this section, the President shall, in particular, seek to ensure that the benefits of such undertakings are available to non-nuclear-weapon states only if such states accept IAEA safeguards on all their peaceful nuclear activities, do not manufacture or otherwise acquire any nuclear explosive device, do not establish any new enrichment or reprocessing facilities under their de facto or de jure control, and place any such existing facilities under effective international auspices and inspection.
  (e) Report on progress of negotiations
     The report required by section 3281 of this title shall include information on the progress made in any negotiations pursuant to this section.
  (f) Congressional approval of non-treaty international undertakings; submission of proposals
    (1) The President may not enter into any binding international undertaking negotiated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section which is not a treaty until such time as such proposed undertaking has been submitted to the Congress and has been approved by concurrent resolution.
    (2) The proposals prepared pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be submitted to the Congress as part of an annual authorization Act for the Department of Energy.
