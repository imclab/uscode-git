      (C) capacity-building for microenterprise institutions in order to enable them to better meet the credit and training needs of microentrepreneurs; and
      (D) policy and regulatory programs at the country level that improve the environment for microentrepreneurs and microenterprise institutions that serve the poor and very poor.

  (c) Monitoring system
     In order to maximize the sustainable development impact of the assistance authorized under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall establish a monitoring system that–
    (1) establishes performance goals for such assistance and expresses such goals in an objective and quantifiable form, to the extent feasible;
    (2) establishes performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing the achievement of the goals and objectives of such assistance;
    (3) provides a basis for recommendations for adjustments to such assistance to enhance the sustainable development impact of such assistance, particularly the impact of such assistance on the very poor, particularly poor women; and
