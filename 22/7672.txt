  (a) Increase in HIV/AIDS antiretroviral treatment
     It is a sense of the Congress that an urgent priority of United States assistance programs to fight HIV/AIDS should be the rapid increase in distribution of antiretroviral treatment so that–
    (1) by the end of fiscal year 2004, at least 500,000 individuals with HIV/AIDS are receiving antiretroviral treatment through United States assistance programs;
    (2) by the end of fiscal year 2005, at least 1,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment; and
    (3) by the end of fiscal year 2006, at least 2,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment.
  (b) Effective distribution of HIV/AIDS funds
     It is the sense of Congress that, of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance, an effective distribution of such amounts would be–
    (1) 55 percent of such amounts for treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS;
    (2) 15 percent of such amounts for palliative care of individuals with HIV/AIDS;
    (3) 20 percent of such amounts for HIV/AIDS prevention consistent with section 2151b–2(d) of this title, of which such amount at least 33 percent should be expended for abstinence-until-marriage programs; and
    (4) 10 percent of such amounts for orphans and vulnerable children.
