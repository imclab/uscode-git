      (A) the extent to which the area is a center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;
      (B) the extent to which State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem;
