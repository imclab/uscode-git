   It is the sense of Congress that, during the transition to a broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, fully representative government in Afghanistan, the United States should supportâ€“
  (1) the development of a civilian-controlled and centrally-governed standing Afghanistan army that respects human rights and prohibits the use of children as soldiers or combatants;
  (2) the creation and training of a professional civilian police force that respects human rights; and
  (3) a multinational security force in Afghanistan.
