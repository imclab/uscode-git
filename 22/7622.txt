  (a) Findings; sense of Congress
    (1) Findings
       Congress makes the following findings:
      (A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].
      (B) The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which–
        (i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and
        (ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.
      (C) The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs–
        (i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and
        (ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.
      (D) The United States Government–
        (i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;
        (ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and
        (iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.
    (2) Sense of Congress
       It is the sense of Congress that–
      (A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;
      (B) the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by–
        (i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;
        (ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and
        (iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;
      (C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;
      (D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;
      (E) the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track–
        (i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant“s fiscal cycle; and
        (ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;
      (F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;
      (G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;
      (H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and
        (I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the ””Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria““ or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.
  (b) Authority for United States participation
    (1) United States participation
       The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.
    (2) Privileges and immunities
       The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of section 288 of this title.
    (3) Statement of policy
       The United States Government regards the imposition by recipient countries of taxes or tariffs on goods or services provided by the Global Fund, which are supported through public and private donations, including the substantial contribution of the American people, as inappropriate and inconsistent with standards of good governance. The Global AIDS Coordinator or other representatives of the United States Government shall work with the Global Fund to dissuade governments from imposing such duties, tariffs, or taxes.
  (c) Reports to Congress
     Not later than 1 year after May 27, 2003, and annually thereafter for the duration of the Global Fund, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions (including donations from the private sector) received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and the mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process.

The President may waive the application of this clause with respect to assistance for Sudan that is overseen by the Southern Country Coordinating Mechanism, including Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State, and Abyei, if the President determines that the national interest or humanitarian reasons justify such a waiver.

        (vi) For the purposes of clause (i), ””funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources““ means funds contributed to the Global Fund at any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2013 that are not contributed to fulfill a commitment made for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2009.
      (B)        (i) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be contributed to the Global Fund as soon as practicable, subject to subparagraph (A)(i), after additional contributions to the Global Fund are made from other sources.
        (ii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be transferred to the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund and shall remain available under the same terms and conditions as funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.

        (ii) The President shall notify the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate not less than 5 days before making a determination under clause (i) with respect to the application of subparagraph (A)(i) and shall include in the notification–
          (I) a justification as to why increased United States Government contributions to the Global Fund is preferable to increased United States assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on a bilateral basis; and
