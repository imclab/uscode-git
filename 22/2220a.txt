  (a) Congressional objectives and findings
     The Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the United States should strengthen the capacities of the United States land-grant and other eligible universities in program-related agricultural institutional development and research, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a–1 of this title, should improve their participation in the United States Government“s international efforts to apply more effective agricultural sciences to the goal of increasing world food production, and in general should provide increased and longer term support to the application of science to solving food and nutrition problems of the developing countries.
     The Congress so declares because it finds–
    (1) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress in this country;
    (2) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with foreign agricultural institutions in expanding indigenous food production for both domestic and international markets;
    (3) that, in a world of growing population with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger but to build the economic base for growth, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current yields are lowest;
    (4) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;
    (5) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional development therefor are prime factors in increasing agricultural production abroad (as well as in the United States) and in improving food distribution, storage, and marketing;
    (6) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture in the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all; and
    (7) that universities need a dependable source of Federal funding, as well as other financing, in order to expand, or in some cases to continue, their efforts to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries.
  (b) Congressional objectives and declaration for collation of components to increase world food production
     Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, various components must be brought together in order to increase world food production, including–
    (1) strengthening the capabilities of universities to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries;
    (2) institution-building programs for development of national and regional agricultural research and extension capacities in developing countries which need assistance;
    (3) international agricultural research centers;
    (4) contract research; and
    (5) research program grants.
  (c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation
     The United States should–
    (1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each component;
    (2) provide mechanisms for the universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component; and
    (3) assist such universities in cooperative joint efforts with–
      (A) agricultural institutions in developing nations, and
      (B) regional and international agricultural research centers,
     directed to strengthening their joint and respective capabilities and to engage them more effectively in research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, distribution, storage, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally underdeveloped nations.
