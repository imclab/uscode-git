   If any funds authorized to be appropriated for any fiscal year for assistance under this chapter are not used for assistance for the country for which those funds were allocated because of the requirements of section 2291j of this title or any other provision of law requiring the withholding of assistance for countries that have not taken adequate steps to halt illicit drug production or trafficking, the President shall use those funds for additional assistance for those countries which have met their illicit drug eradication targets or have otherwise taken significant steps to halt illicit drug production or trafficking, as follows:
  (1) International narcotics control assistance
     Those funds may be transferred to and consolidated with the funds appropriated to carry out this part in order to provide additional narcotics control assistance for those countries. Funds transferred under this paragraph may only be used to provide increased funding for activities previously justified to the Congress. Transfers may be made under this paragraph without regard to the 20-percent increase limitation contained in section 2360(a) of this title. This paragraph does not apply with respect to funds made available for assistance under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].
  (2) Other assistance
     Any such funds not used under paragraph (1) shall be reprogrammed within the account for which they were appropriated (subject to the regular reprogramming procedures under section 2394â€“1 of this title) in order to provide additional assistance for those countries.
