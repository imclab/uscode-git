  (a) Congressional policy; general authority
     The Congress recognizes that United States assistance is necessary to help developing countries in Africa meet the longer term rehabilitation and resettlement needs of displaced persons and other innocent victims of civil strife. Therefore, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for the longer term rehabilitation and resettlement needs of such victims. Funds for this purpose should be used to assist African governments in providing semipermanent housing, potable water supply systems, and sanitary facilities which are generally not provided by existing refugee relief agencies.
  (b) Authorization of appropriations
     There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for the purposes of this section, in addition to amounts otherwise available for such purposes, $15,000,000 for the fiscal year 1981. Amounts appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.
  (c) Provisions of section 2292 of this title applicable to this section
     Assistance under this section shall be provided in accordance with the policies and general authorities contained in section 2292 of this title.
