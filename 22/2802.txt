    (2) a report by the Secretary of State that the proposed exposition qualifies for consideration of registration by the Bureau of International Expositions (hereafter referred to as BIE); and
    (3) such other evidence as the President may consider to be appropriate.
  (b) Recognition and registration procedure; compliance with international convention; participation by States and foreign governments
     Upon a finding by the President that an international exposition is eligible for Federal recognition, the President may take such measures recognizing the exposition as he deems proper, including, but not limited to–
    (1) presenting of an official request by the United States for registration of the exposition by the BIE;
    (2) providing for fulfillment of the requirements of the Convention of November 22, 1928, as amended, relating to international expositions; and
    (3) extending invitations, by proclamation or by such other manner he deems proper, to the several States of the Union and to foreign governments to take part in the exposition, provided that he shall not extend such an invitation until he has been notified officially of BIE registration for the exposition.
  (c) Report to Congress
     The President shall report his actions under this section promptly to the Congress.
