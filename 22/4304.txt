     If the Secretary determines that such action is reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or otherwise–

  (d) Agent for waiver of recourse
     For purposes of effectuating a waiver of recourse which is required under this section, the Secretary may designate any officer of the Department of State as the agent of a foreign mission (or of any assignee of or person deriving rights from a foreign mission).
