    (1) members of the Senior Foreign Service, and
    (2) members of the Service assigned to a salary class in the Foreign Service Schedule (including promotions of such members into the Senior Foreign Service),
       shall be based upon the recommendations and rankings of selection boards established under section 4002 of this title, except that the Secretary may by regulation specify categories of career members, categories of career candidates, and other members of the Service assigned to salary classes in the Foreign Service Schedule who may receive promotions on the basis of satisfactory performance.

The Secretary shall prescribe the length of the period after such a request is made (within any applicable time in class limitation established under section 4007(a) of this title) during which such members may be considered by selection boards for entry into the Senior Foreign Service. A request by a member for consideration for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service under this subsection may be withdrawn by the member, but if it is withdrawn, that member may not thereafter request consideration for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service.
    (2) Decisions by the Secretary on the numbers of individuals to be promoted into and retained in the Senior Foreign Service shall be based upon a systematic long-term projection of personnel flows and needs designed to provide–
      (A) a regular, predictable flow of recruitment in the Service;
      (B) effective career development patterns to meet the needs of the Service; and
      (C) a regular, predictable flow of talent upward through the ranks and into the Senior Foreign Service.
    (3) The affidavit requirements of sections 3332 and 3333(a) of title 5 shall not apply with respect to a member of the Service who has previously complied with those requirements and who subsequently is promoted by appointment to any class in the Senior Foreign Service without a break in service.
    (4) Not later than March 1, 2001, and every four years thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate which shall include the following:
      (A) A description of the steps taken and planned in furtherance of–
        (i) maximum compatibility among agencies utilizing the Foreign Service personnel system, as provided for in section 3923 of this title, and
        (ii) the development of uniform policies and procedures and consolidated personnel functions, as provided for in section 3924 of this title.
      (B) A workforce plan for the subsequent five years, including projected personnel needs, by grade and by skill. Each such plan shall include for each category the needs for foreign language proficiency, geographic and functional expertise, and specialist technical skills. Each workforce plan shall specifically account for the training needs of Foreign Service personnel and shall delineate an intake program of generalist and specialist Foreign Service personnel to meet projected future requirements.
    (5) If there are substantial modifications to any workforce plan under paragraph (4)(B) during any year in which a report under paragraph (4) is not required, a supplemental annual notification shall be submitted in the same manner as reports are required to be submitted under paragraph (4).
