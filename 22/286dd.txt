   The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund–
  (1) to oppose and vote against any Fund drawing by a member country where, in his judgment, the Fund resources would be drawn principally for the purpose of repaying loans which have been imprudently made by banking institutions to the member country; and
  (2) to work to insure that the Fund encourages borrowing countries and banking institutions to negotiate, where appropriate, a rescheduling of debt which is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and the country“s ability to pay.
