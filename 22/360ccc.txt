      (B) full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe under section 360b(d) of this title (including, for an antimicrobial new animal drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance) and there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness for use;
      (C) data for establishing a conditional dose;
      (D) projections of expected need and the justification for that expectation based on the best information available;
      (E) information regarding the quantity of drug expected to be distributed on an annual basis to meet the expected need; and
      (F) a commitment that the applicant will conduct additional investigations to meet the requirements for the full demonstration of effectiveness under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of this title within 5 years.
    (3) A person may not file an application under paragraph (1) if–
      (A) the application seeks conditional approval of a new animal drug that is contained in, or is a product of, a transgenic animal.\2\N
      (B) the person has previously filed an application for conditional approval under paragraph (1) for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use whether or not subsequently conditionally approved by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section, or
      (C) the person obtained the application, or data or other information contained therein, directly or indirectly from the person who filed for conditional approval under paragraph (1) for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use whether or not subsequently conditionally approved by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section.
  (b) Order of approval or hearing
     Within 180 days after the filing of an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or such additional period as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the applicant, the Secretary shall either–
    (1) issue an order, effective for one year, conditionally approving the application if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds for denying conditional approval, specified in subsection (c) of this section applies and publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval, or
    (2) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for an informal hearing on the question whether such application can be conditionally approved.
  (c) Order of approval or refusal after hearing
     If the Secretary finds, after giving the applicant notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing, that–
    (1) any of the provisions of section 360b(d)(1)(A) through (D) or (F) through (I) of this title are applicable;
    (2) the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the application and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such drug, is insufficient to show that there is a reasonable expectation that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; or
    (3) another person has received approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use, and that person is able to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended;
       the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to conditionally approve the application. If, after such notice and opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary finds that paragraphs (1) through (3) do not apply, the Secretary shall issue an order conditionally approving the application effective for one year and publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval. Any order issued under this subsection refusing to conditionally approve an application shall state the findings upon which it is based.
  (d) Effective period; renewal; refusal of renewal
     A conditional approval under this section is effective for a 1-year period and is thereafter renewable by the Secretary annually for up to 4 additional 1-year terms.

    (2) A conditional approval shall be deemed renewed at the end of the 1-year period, or at the end of a 90-day extension that the Secretary may, at the Secretary“s discretion, grant by letter in order to complete review of the renewal request, unless the Secretary determines before the expiration of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension that–
      (A) the applicant failed to submit a timely renewal request;
      (B) the request fails to contain sufficient information to show that–
        (i) the applicant is making sufficient progress toward meeting approval requirements under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of this title, and is likely to be able to fulfill those requirements and obtain an approval under section 360b of this title before the expiration of the 5-year maximum term of the conditional approval;
        (ii) the quantity of the drug that has been distributed is consistent with the conditionally approved intended use and conditions of use, unless there is adequate explanation that ensures that the drug is only used for its intended purpose; or
        (iii) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has not received approval under section 360b of this title, or if such a drug has been approved, that the holder of the approved application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended; or
      (C) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable.
    (3) If the Secretary determines before the end of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension, if granted, that a conditional approval should not be renewed, the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to renew the conditional approval, and such conditional approval shall be deemed withdrawn and no longer in effect. The Secretary shall thereafter provide an opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant on the issue whether the conditional approval shall be reinstated.
  (e) Withdrawal of conditional approval
    (1) The Secretary shall issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary finds that another person has received approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use and that person is able to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended.
    (2) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary finds that–
      (A) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable; or
      (B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary with respect to such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the application was conditionally approved, that there is not a reasonable expectation that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.
    (3) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary finds that any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(2) of this title are applicable.
  (f) Labeling
    (1) The label and labeling of a new animal drug with a conditional approval under this section shall–
      (A) bear the statement, ””conditionally approved by FDA pending a full demonstration of effectiveness under application number““; and
      (B) contain such other information as prescribed by the Secretary.
    (2) An intended use that is the subject of a conditional approval under this section shall not be included in the same product label with any intended use approved under section 360b of this title.
  (g) Amendment of application
     A conditionally approved new animal drug application may not be amended or supplemented to add indications for use.
  (h) Order of approval after conditional approval period termination
     180 days prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, an applicant shall have submitted all the information necessary to support a complete new animal drug application in accordance with section 360b(b)(1) of this title or the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect. Following review of this information, the Secretary shall either–
    (1) issue an order approving the application under section 360b(c) of this title if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds for denying approval specified in section 360b(d)(1) of this title applies, or
    (2) give the applicant an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary under section 360b(d) of this title on the question whether such application can be approved.
       Upon issuance of an order approving the application, product labeling and administrative records of approval shall be modified accordingly. If the Secretary has not issued an order under section 360b(c) of this title approving such application prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect unless the Secretary grants an extension of an additional 180-day period so that the Secretary can complete review of the application. The decision to grant an extension is committed to the discretion of the Secretary and not subject to judicial review.
      (i) Judicial review
         The decision of the Secretary under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section refusing or withdrawing conditional approval of an application shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
      (j) Definition
