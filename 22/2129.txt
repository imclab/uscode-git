  (a) Amount
     Any commercial airline or commercial cruise ship line which is found by the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, to have failed to pay to the Secretary, by the due date, the fee charged by the Secretary under section 2128(a) of this title, may be ordered by the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee to pay any fee amount outstanding plus interest on any late payment and, in addition, to pay a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day payment to the Secretary is not made or was made late. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, and history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require. Each day a payment to the Secretary required by this chapter is late shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter.
  (b) Civil action for recovery of penalty
     If any commercial airline or cruise ship line fails to pay as ordered by the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee, the Attorney General may, upon request of the Secretary, bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for the recovery of the amount ordered to be paid.
  (c) Compromise, modification, or remitment of civil penalty
     Before requesting the Attorney General to bring a civil action, the Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under subsection (a) of this section.
  (d) Subpoenas
     For the purpose of conducting any hearing under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this subsection, the United States district court for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee or to appear and produce papers, books, and documents before the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.
