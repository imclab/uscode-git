   The Congress finds thatâ€“
  (1) United States assistance to the multilateral development banks should promote sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, public health, and the status of indigenous peoples in developing countries;
  (2) multilateral development bank projects, policies, and loans have failed in some cases to provide adequate safeguards for the environment, public health, natural resources, and indigenous peoples;
  (3) many development efforts of the multilateral development banks are more enduring and less costly if based on consultations with directly affected population groups and communities;
  (4) developing country governments sometimes do not ensure that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to use natural resources sustainably or consult with affected population groups and communities, where costs could be reduced or benefits made more enduring; and
  (5) in general, the multilateral development banks do not yet provide systematic and adequate assistance to their borrowers to encourage sustainable resource use and consultation with affected communities, where costs could be reduced or benefits made more enduring.
