   Section, act Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 144, 38 Stat. 1102, related to payment of the cost of inspection under a provision authorizing the investigation of the character of chemical and physical tests applied to American food products in foreign countries and the inspection of such products before shipment to such countries at the request of the shippers or owners. That provision was repeated in subsequent appropriation acts but was omitted from the appropriation act of July 12, 1943, ch. 221, 57 Stat. 494, and from all subsequent appropriation acts.
