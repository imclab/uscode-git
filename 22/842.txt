    (9) who is a regulated person to engage in a regulated transaction without obtaining the identification required by 830(a)(3) of this title.\1\N
    (10) negligently to fail to keep a record or make a report under section 830 of this title; or
    (11) to distribute a laboratory supply to a person who uses, or attempts to use, that laboratory supply to manufacture a controlled substance or a listed chemical, in violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, with reckless disregard for the illegal uses to which such a laboratory supply will be put.
