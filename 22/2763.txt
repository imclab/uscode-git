      (A) the term ””concessional rate of interest““ means any rate of interest which is less than market rates of interest; and
      (B) the term ””market rate of interest““ means any rate of interest which is equal to or greater than the current average interest rate (as of the last day of the month preceding the financing of the procurement under this section) that the United States Government pays on outstanding marketable obligations of comparable maturity.

  (g) Notification requirements with respect to cash flow financing
    (1) For each country and international organization that has been approved for cash flow financing under this section, any letter of offer and acceptance or other purchase agreement, or any amendment thereto, for a procurement of defense articles, defense services, or design and construction services in excess of $100,000,000 that is to be financed in whole or in part with funds made available under this chapter or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.] shall be submitted to the congressional committees specified in section 634A(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2394–1(a)] in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under that section.
