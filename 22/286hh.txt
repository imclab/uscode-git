  (a) Criteria
     The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to advocate and support the facilitation of voluntary market-based programs for the reduction of sovereign debt and the promotion of sustainable economic development, which, if implemented, would–

    (4) encourage participating countries to make economic adjustments steadily and over a period of time in order to achieve policy reform;
    (5) use debt reduction techniques that would not compensate commercial banks for the reduction in the value of such debt, but would serve as a catalyst for new lending;
    (6) involve such bank in lending for purposes of debt reduction and conversion only where such involvement would not lower the credit rating of such bank;
    (7) not require public sector funding beyond that provided through any capital increase for such bank, and any replenishment for the International Development Association, which is agreed to by the member countries of such institutions; and
