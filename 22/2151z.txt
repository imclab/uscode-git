  (a) Determination of target populations and strengthening United States assistance
     The President shall use poverty measurement standards, such as those developed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other appropriate measurements in determining target populations for United States development assistance, and shall strengthen United States efforts to assure that a substantial percentage of development assistance under this part directly improves the lives of the poor majority, with special emphasis on those individuals living in absolute poverty.
  (b) Ultimate beneficiaries of activities
     To the maximum extent possible, activities under this part that attempt to increase the institutional capabilities of private organizations or governments, or that attempt to stimulate scientific and technological research, shall be designed and monitored to ensure that the ultimate beneficiaries of these activities are the poor majority.
