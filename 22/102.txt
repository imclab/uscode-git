For this purpose he may have and maintain possession of all lands, buildings, animals, tools, fixtures, and appurtenances in use on August 3, 1890, for the quarantine of neat cattle, and purchase, construct, or rent as may be necessary, and he may appoint veterinary surgeons, inspectors, officers, and employees by him deemed necessary to maintain such quarantine, and provide for the execution of the other provisions of this subchapter.
