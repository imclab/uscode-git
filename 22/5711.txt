  (1) The United States should play an active role, before, on, and after July 1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong“s confidence and prosperity, Hong Kong“s role as an international financial center, and the mutually beneficial ties between the people of the United States and the people of Hong Kong.
  (2) The United States should actively seek to establish and expand direct bilateral ties and agreements with Hong Kong in economic, trade, financial, monetary, aviation, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural, sport, and other appropriate areas.
  (3) The United States should seek to maintain, after June 30, 1997, the United States consulate-general in Hong Kong, together with other official and semi-official organizations, such as the United States Information Agency American Library.

The United States should invite Hong Kong to open and maintain other official or semi-official missions to represent Hong Kong in those areas in which Hong Kong is entitled to maintain relations on its own, including economic, trade, financial, monetary, aviation, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural, and sport areas.
  (5) The United States should recognize passports and travel documents issued after June 30, 1997, by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
  (6) The resumption by the People“s Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong after June 30, 1997, should not affect treatment of Hong Kong residents who apply for visas to visit or reside permanently in the United States, so long as such treatment is consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.].
