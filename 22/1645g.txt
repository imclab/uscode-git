   With respect to any claim under section 1645b of this title which, at the time of the award, is vested in persons other than the person by whom the original loss was sustained, the Commission shall issue a consolidated award in favor of all claimants then entitled to the award, which award shall indicate the respective interests of such claimants in the award, and all such claimants shall participate, in proportion to their indicated interests, in any payments that may be made under this subchapter in all respects as if the award had been in favor of a single person.
