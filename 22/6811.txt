  (a) Statement of policy
     It is in the national interest of the United States to assist in mitigating the burden that will be placed on sub-Saharan African social, economic, and political institutions as these institutions struggle with the consequences of a dramatically increasing AIDS orphan population, many of whom are themselves infected by HIV and living with AIDS. Effectively addressing that burden and its consequences in sub-Saharan Africa will require a coordinated multidonor strategy.
  (b) Development of strategy
     The President shall coordinate the development of a multidonor strategy to provide for the support and education of AIDS orphans and the families, communities, and institutions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.
  (c) Definition
     In this section, the term ””HIV/AIDS““ means, with respect to an individual, an individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), or living with AIDS.
