  (a) T4Indian Tribes and Alaskan Natives VillagesK.–If there is in a State an Indian tribe or Alaskan native \1\N village having a recognized governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers, the Secretary shall allocate to the tribe or village, out of the amount allocated to the State under section 6704, an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount allocated to the State as the population of the tribe or village bears to the population of the State. The Secretary shall allocate amounts under this subsection to Indian tribes and Alaskan native \1\ villages in a State before allocating amounts to units of general local government in the State under subsection (c). For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall use as the population of each Indian tribe or Alaskan native \1\ village the population for 1991 as reported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the publication Indian Service Population and Labor Force Estimates (January 1991). In addition to uses authorized under section 6701(a)(2), amounts allocated under this subsection and paid to an Indian tribe or Alaskan native \1\ village under this chapter may be used for renovating or building prisons or other correctional facilities.
  (b) T4Newly Incorporated Local Governments and Annexed GovernmentsK.–If there is in a State a unit of general local government that has been incorporated since the date of the collection of the data used by the Secretary in making allocations pursuant to sections 6704 through 6706 and 6708, the Secretary shall allocate to this newly incorporated local government, out of the amount allocated to the State under section 6704, an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount allocated to the State as the population of the newly incorporated local government bears to the population of the State. If there is in the State a unit of general local government that has been annexed since the date of the collection of the data used by the Secretary in making allocations pursuant to sections 6704 through 6706 and 6708, the Secretary shall pay the amount that would have been allocated to this local government to the unit of general local government that annexed it.
  (c) T4Other Local Government Allocations.–
    (1) T4In generalK.–The Secretary shall allocate among the units of general local government in a State (other than units receiving allocations under subsection (a)) the amount allocated to the State under section 6704 (as that amount is reduced by allocations under subsection (a)).

      (II) the chief executive officer of the State notifies the Secretary that the taxes satisfy the requirements of this clause.
    (iii) The adjusted taxes of a unit of general local government shall not exceed the maximum allowable adjusted taxes for that unit.

    (vii) For purposes of this subparagraph–
      (I) the term ””per capita adjusted taxes of all units of general local government of the same type““ means the sum of the adjusted taxes of all units of general local government of the same type divided by the sum of the populations of all units of general local government of the same type; and
