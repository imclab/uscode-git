  (a) A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this chapter may be filed under section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605).
  (b)    (1) An interest penalty under this chapter does not continue to accrueâ€“
      (A) after a claim for a penalty is filed under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); or
      (B) for more than one year.
    (2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not prevent an interest penalty from accruing under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) after a penalty stops accruing under this chapter. A penalty accruing under section 12 may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this chapter.
  (c) Except as provided in section 3904 of this title, this chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract. A claim related to the dispute, and interest payable for the period during which the dispute is being resolved, is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
