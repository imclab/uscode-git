As directed by the Secretary, each depositary shall report to the Secretary on public money paid and received by the depositary.
  (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that Social Security account numbers (including derivatives of such numbers) are not visible on or through unopened mailings of checks or other drafts described in subsection (a) of this section.
