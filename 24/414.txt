     The Administrator of each facility of the Retirement Home shall collect a monthly fee from each resident of that facility.
  (b) Deposit of fees
     The Administrators shall deposit fees collected under subsection (a) of this section in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.
  (c) Fixing fees
    (1) The Chief Operating Officer, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense, shall from time to time prescribe the fees required by subsection (a) of this section. Changes to such fees shall be based on the financial needs of the Retirement Home and the ability of the residents to pay. A change of a fee may not take effect until 120 days after the Secretary of Defense transmits a notification of the change to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
    (2) The fee shall be fixed as a percentage of the monthly income and monthly payments (including Federal payments) received by a resident. The percentage shall be the same for each facility of the Retirement Home. The Secretary of Defense may make any adjustment in a percentage that the Secretary determines appropriate.
    (3) The fee shall be subject to a limitation on maximum monthly amount. The amount of the limitation shall be increased, effective on January 1 of each year, by the percentage of the increase in retired pay and retainer pay that takes effect on the preceding December 1 under subsection (b) of section 1401a of title 10 without regard to paragraph (3) of such subsection.
