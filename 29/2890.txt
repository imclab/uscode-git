  (a) Personal allowances
     The Secretary may provide enrollees assigned to Job Corps centers with such personal allowances as the Secretary may determine to be necessary or appropriate to meet the needs of the enrollees.
  (b) Readjustment allowances
    (1) Graduates
       The Secretary shall arrange for a readjustment allowance to be paid to graduates. The Secretary shall arrange for the allowance to be paid at the one-stop center nearest to the home of the graduate who is returning home, or at the one-stop center nearest to the location where the graduate has indicated an intent to seek employment. If the Secretary uses any organization, in lieu of a one-stop center, to provide placement services under this Act, the Secretary shall arrange for that organization to pay the readjustment allowance.
    (2) Former enrollees
       The Secretary may provide for a readjustment allowance to be paid to former enrollees. The provision of the readjustment allowance shall be subject to the same requirements as are applicable to the provision of the readjustment allowance paid to graduates under paragraph (1).
