  (a) Findings
     The Congress finds that–
    (1) the Nation has a vested interest in building a quality and productive workforce that will enable the United States to compete effectively in the global marketplace;
    (2) two in every three new entrants to the workforce during the 1990“s will be women, and such women need appropriate basic and occupational skills to fill jobs requiring much higher skill levels than the jobs of today;
    (3) there are approximately 15,600,000 displaced homemakers in the United States, the majority of whom are women not in the labor force, who live in poverty and who require educational, vocational, training and other services to obtain financial independence and economic security; and
    (4) Federal, State, and local programs addressing the training and employment needs of displaced homemakers have been fragmented and insufficient to serve displaced homemakers effectively.
  (b) Purpose
     It is the purpose of this chapter to provide assistance to States to provide coordination and referral services, support service assistance, and program and technical assistance to displaced homemakers and displaced homemaker service providers. Such assistance will enable public and private entities to better meet the needs of displaced homemakers and will expand the employment and self-sufficiency options of displaced homemakers.
