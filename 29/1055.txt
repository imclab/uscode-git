  (a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans
     Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and–
    (1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and
    (2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.
  (b) Enumeration of plan requirements
    (1)      (A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than–
        (i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by
        (ii) the number of years (not in excess of 33\1/3\) of his participation in the plan.
           In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
      (B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 133\1/3\ percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph–
        (i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;
        (ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;
        (iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and
        (iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.
      (C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
      (D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of–
        (i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or
        (ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.
      (E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ””year of service““ has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.
      (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan
        (i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and
        (ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),
           but only if an employee“s accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.
      (G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant“s accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan–
        (i) do not exceed social security benefits, and
        (ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.
      (H)        (i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee“s benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee“s benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
        (ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.
        (iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan–
          (I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and
          (II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.
             The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.
        (iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.
        (v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.
        (vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).
    (2)      (A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee“s account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee“s account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
      (B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.
      (C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).
    (3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if–
      (A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee“s accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and
      (B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee“s accrued benefit.
    (4)      (A) For purposes of determining an employee“s accrued benefit, the term ””year of participation““ means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.
      (B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee“s service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.
      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.
      (D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term ””year of participation““ shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
      (E) For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.
  (c) Employee“s accrued benefits derived from employer and employee contributions
    (1) For purposes of this section and section 1053 of this title an employee“s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.
    (2)      (A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is–
        (i) except as provided in clause (ii), the balance of the employee“s separate account consisting only of his contributions and the income, expenses, gains, and losses attributable thereto, or
        (ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee“s contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee“s contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).
      (B) T4Defined benefit plansK.–In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee“s accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date).
      (C) For purposes of this subsection, the term ””accumulated contributions““ means the total of–
        (i) all mandatory contributions made by the employee,
        (ii) interest (if any) under the plan to the end of the last plan year to which section 1053(a)(2) of this title does not apply (by reason of the applicable effective date), and
        (iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually–
          (I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of a plan year for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) of this section applies by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and
          (II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.
             For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ””mandatory contributions““ means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plans, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.
      (D) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.
    (3) For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee“s accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee“s accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).
    (4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee“s accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.
  (d) Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee“s accrued benefits under plan
     Notwithstanding section 1053(b)(1) of this title, for purposes of determining the employee“s accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received–
    (1) a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than $3,500) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or
    (2) a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.
       Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee“s participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee“s participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
  (e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service
     For purposes of determining the employee“s accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) of this section unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) of this section with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and provides that upon such repayment the employee“s accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who–
    (1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,
    (2) resumes employment covered under the plan, and
    (3) repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section.
       The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (B) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.
  (f) Employer treated as maintaining a plan
     For the purposes of this part, an employer shall be treated as maintaining a plan if any employee of such employer accrues benefits under such plan by reason of service with such employer.
  (g) Decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan
    (1) The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) or 1441 of this title.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of–
      (A) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or
      (B) eliminating an optional form of benefit,
         with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).
    (3) For purposes of this subsection, any–
      (A) tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 409(a) of title 26, or
      (B) employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26),
         shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because it modifies distribution options in a nondiscriminatory manner.
  (h) Notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals
    (1) A plan described in paragraph (2) may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual, unless, after adoption of the plan amendment and not less than 15 days before the effective date of the plan amendment, the plan administrator provides a written notice, setting forth the plan amendment and its effective date, to–
      (A) each participant in the plan,
      (B) each beneficiary who is an alternate payee (within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title) under an applicable qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title), and
      (C) each employee organization representing participants in the plan,
         except that such notice shall instead be provided to a person designated, in writing, to receive such notice on behalf of any person referred to in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).
    (2) A plan is described in this paragraph if such plan is–
      (A) a defined benefit plan, or
      (B) an individual account plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 1082 of this title.
        (i) Prohibition on benefit increases where plan sponsor is in bankruptcy
          (1) In the case of a plan described in paragraph (3) which is maintained by an employer that is a debtor in a case under title 11 or similar Federal or State law, no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of–
            (A) any increase in benefits,
            (B) any change in the accrual of benefits, or
            (C) any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan,
               with respect to employees of the debtor, shall be effective prior to the effective date of such employer“s plan of reorganization.
          (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any plan amendment that–
            (A) the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be reasonable and that provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan with respect to employees of the debtor,
            (B) only repeals an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title,
            (C) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26, or
            (D) was adopted prior to, or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement entered into prior to, the date on which the employer became a debtor in a case under title 11 or similar Federal or State law.
          (3) This subsection shall apply only to plans (other than multiemployer plans) covered under section 1321 of this title for which the funded current liability percentage (within the meaning of section 1082(d)(8) of this title) is less than 100 percent after taking into account the effect of the amendment.
          (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term ””employer““ has the meaning set forth in section 1082(c)(11)(A) of this title, without regard to section 1082(c)(11)(B) of this title.
        (j) Cross reference
