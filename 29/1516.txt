  (a) Findings
     The Congress recognizes that job training is an investment in human capital and not an expense. In order to determine whether that investment has been productive, the Congress finds that–
    (1) it is essential that criteria for measuring the return on this investment be developed; and
    (2) the basic return on the investment is to be measured by long-term economic self-sufficiency, increased employment and earnings, reductions in welfare dependency, and increased educational attainment and occupational skills.
  (b) Subchapter II performance standards
    (1) General objective
       In prescribing performance standards for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary shall ensure that States and service delivery areas will make efforts to increase services and positive outcomes for hard-to-serve individuals.
    (2) Achievement of basic measures
       In order to determine whether the basic measures described in subsection (a) of this section are achieved for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall prescribe performance standards.
    (3) Factors for adult standards
       The Secretary shall base the performance standards for adult programs under part A of subchapter II of this chapter on appropriate factors, which may include–
      (A) placement in unsubsidized employment;
      (B) retention for not less than 6 months in unsubsidized employment;
      (C) an increase in earnings, including hourly wages;
      (D) a reduction in welfare dependency; and
      (E) acquisition of skills, including basic skills, required to promote continued employability in the local labor market (including attainment of the competency levels described in paragraph (5)), or acquisition of a high school diploma or the equivalent of the diploma, if the acquisition of such skills or diploma is in addition to obtaining one or more of the outcomes described in subparagraphs (A) through (D).
    (4) Factors for youth standards
      (A) In general
         The Secretary shall base the performance standards for youth programs under part C of subchapter II of this chapter on appropriate factors described in paragraph (3), and on factors including–

        (ii) dropout prevention and recovery;

    (5) Competency levels
       The private industry councils, in consultation with appropriate educational agencies, and, where appropriate, the private sector, labor organizations, and community-based organizations, shall establish youth and adult competency levels, based on such factors as entry level skills and other hiring requirements.
    (6) Requirements
       The performance standards described in paragraphs (3) and (4) shall include provisions governing–
      (A) the base period prior to program participation that will be used for measurement of the factors in such paragraphs, as appropriate;
      (B) a representative period after termination from the program that is a reasonable indicator of postprogram employment, earnings, and cash welfare payment reductions; and
      (C) cost-effective methods for obtaining such data as are necessary to carry out this section and section 1732(d) of this title which, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may include access to earnings records, State employment security records, records collected under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) [26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], records collected under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], statistical sampling techniques, and similar records or measures, with appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information obtained.

      (E) exceed the performance standards established by the Governor under subsection (e) of this section for programs under subchapter II of this chapter, except that not more than 25 percent of the incentive grants shall be awarded on performance standards established under subsection (e) of this section.
    (8) Program expenditures
       The Secretary shall prescribe performance standards relating gross program expenditures to various performance measures under this subsection, excluding any cost per participant measure. The Governors shall not take performance standards prescribed under this paragraph into consideration in awarding incentive grants under paragraph (7).

          (C) Alternative administrative entity selection
             The alternative administrative entity described in subparagraph (B) may be a newly formed private industry council or any agency jointly selected by the Governor and the chief elected official of the largest unit of general local government in the service delivery area or substate area.
