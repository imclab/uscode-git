  (a) Stringent enforcement; dismissal or transfer
     Within Job Corps centers standards of conduct shall be provided and stringently enforced. If violations are committed by enrollees, dismissal from the Corps or transfers to other locations shall be made if it is determined that their retention in the Corps, or in the particular center, will jeopardize the enforcement of such standards or diminish the opportunities of other enrollees.
  (b) Disciplinary measures by center directors; appeal to Secretary
     To promote the proper moral and disciplinary conditions in the Job Corps, the directors of Job Corps centers shall take appropriate disciplinary measures against enrollees, including dismissal from the Job Corps, subject to expeditious appeal to the Secretary.
