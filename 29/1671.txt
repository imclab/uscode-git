  (a) In general
     From funds made available to carry out this section, the Secretary may make grants to States, substate grantees, employers, employer associations, and representatives of employees to provide training, adjustment assistance, and employment services to eligible employees adversely affected by reductions in expenditures by the United States for defense, by closures of United States military facilities, or by reductions in the export of defense articles and defense services as a result of United States policy, including reductions in the amount of defense articles and defense services under agreements to provide such articles or services or through termination or completion of any such agreements. For purposes of this section, an eligible employee is an eligible dislocated worker as defined in section 1651(a) of this title who has been terminated or laid off, or has received a notice of termination or lay off, as a consequence of reductions in expenditures by the United States for defense, by closures of United States military facilities, or by reductions in the export of defense articles and defense services as a result of United States policy, including reductions in the amount of defense articles and defense services under agreements to provide such articles or services or through termination or completion of any such agreements as determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary.

     Grants under subsection (a) of this section may be used for any purpose for which funds may be used under section 1661c of this title or this part.
  (d) Demonstration projects
     In carrying out the grant program established under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may make grants to entities referred to in that subsection for the purpose of developing demonstration projects to encourage and promote innovative responses to the dislocation resulting from reductions in expenditures by the United States for defense, by closures of United States military facilities, or by reductions in the export of defense articles and defense services as a result of United States policy, including reductions in the amount of defense articles and defense services under agreements to provide such articles or services or through termination or completion of any such agreements.
