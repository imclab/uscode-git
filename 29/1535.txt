     No provision of this part or any other provision of Federal law shall be construed to prohibit any State from combining or consolidating Federal administrative management information reporting requirements relating to employment, productivity, or training, if notice is transmitted by the Governor to the head of each appropriate Federal and State agency responsible for the laws governing the Federal reporting requirements. The notice shall specify the intent to combine or consolidate such requirements. The head of each appropriate Federal agency shall approve the combination or consolidation unless, within sixty days after receiving the notice, the Federal agency can demonstrate that the combination or consolidation will not meet the essential purposes of the affected Federal law.
