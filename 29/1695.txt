  (a) Disciplinary standards for enrollees
     No individual shall be selected as an enrollee unless there is reasonable expectation that the individual can participate successfully in group situations and activities, is not likely to engage in behavior that would prevent other enrollees from receiving the benefit of the program or be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships between the center to which the individual might be assigned and surrounding communities, and unless the individual manifests a basic understanding of both the rules to which the individual will be subject and of the consequences of failure to observe those rules.
  (b) Enrollees on probation, parole, or supervised release; contact with criminal justice system no bar
     An individual on probation, parole, or supervised release may be selected only if release from the supervision of the probation or parole officials is satisfactory to those officials and the Secretary and does not violate applicable laws or regulations. No individual shall be denied a position in the Job Corps solely on the basis of that individualâ€œs contact with the criminal justice system.
