  (a) Commencement date for payment of benefits
     Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which–
    (1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,
    (2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or
    (3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.
       In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
  (b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937
     If–
    (1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or
    (2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,
       a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.
  (c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions
     No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant“s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.
  (d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits
    (1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant“s accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.
    (3)      (A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.
      (B) For purposes of this paragraph–
        (i) the term ””qualified domestic relations order““ means a domestic relations order–
          (I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee“s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and
          (II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and
        (ii) the term ””domestic relations order““ means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which–
          (I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and
          (II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).
      (C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies–
        (i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,
        (ii) the amount or percentage of the participant“s benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,
        (iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and
        (iv) each plan to which such order applies.
      (D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order–
        (i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,
        (ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and
        (iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
      (E)        (i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee–
          (I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,
          (II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and
          (III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).
             For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.
        (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ””earliest retirement age““ means the earlier of–
          (I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or
          (II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.
      (F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order–
        (i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and
        (ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.
      (G)        (i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan–
          (I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan“s procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and
          (II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.
        (ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures–
          (I) shall be in writing,
          (II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and
          (III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.
      (H)        (i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the ””segregated amounts““) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
        (ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.
        (iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)–
          (I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or
          (II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,
             then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.
        (iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.
        (v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.
          (I) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in–
            (i) treating a domestic relations order as being (or not being) a qualified domestic relations order, or
            (ii) taking action under subparagraph (H),
               then the plan“s obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.
          (J) A person who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this chapter a beneficiary under the plan. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall permit a requirement under section 1301 of this title of the payment of more than 1 premium with respect to a participant for any period.
          (K) The term ””alternate payee““ means any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.
          (L) This paragraph shall not apply to any plan to which paragraph (1) does not apply.
          (M) Payment of benefits by a pension plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of a qualified domestic relations order shall not be treated as garnishment for purposes of section 1673(a) of title 15.
          (N) In prescribing regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any offset of a participant“s benefits provided under an employee pension benefit plan against an amount that the participant is ordered or required to pay to the plan if–
      (A) the order or requirement to pay arises–
        (i) under a judgment of conviction for a crime involving such plan,
        (ii) under a civil judgment (including a consent order or decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle, or
        (iii) pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary and the participant, or a settlement agreement between the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person,
      (B) the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the plan against the participant“s benefits provided under the plan, and
      (C) in a case in which the survivor annuity requirements of section 1055 of this title apply with respect to distributions from the plan to the participant, if the participant has a spouse at the time at which the offset is to be made–
        (i) either–
          (I) such spouse has consented in writing to such offset and such consent is witnessed by a notary public or representative of the plan (or it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that such consent may not be obtained by reason of circumstances described in section 1055(c)(2)(B) of this title), or
          (II) an election to waive the right of the spouse to a qualified joint and survivor annuity or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity is in effect in accordance with the requirements of section 1055(c) of this title,
        (ii) such spouse is ordered or required in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement to pay an amount to the plan in connection with a violation of part 4 of this subtitle, or
        (iii) in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement, such spouse retains the right to receive the survivor annuity under a qualified joint and survivor annuity provided pursuant to section 1055(a)(1) of this title and under a qualified preretirement survivor annuity provided pursuant to section 1055(a)(2) of this title, determined in accordance with paragraph (5).
           A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 1055 of this title solely by reason of an offset under this paragraph.
    (5)      (A) The survivor annuity described in paragraph (4)(C)(iii) shall be determined as if–
        (i) the participant terminated employment on the date of the offset,
        (ii) there was no offset,
        (iii) the plan permitted commencement of benefits only on or after normal retirement age,
        (iv) the plan provided only the minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity, and
        (v) the amount of the qualified preretirement survivor annuity under the plan is equal to the amount of the survivor annuity payable under the minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity.
      (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity““ means the qualified joint and survivor annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the participant“s accrued benefit (within the meaning of section 1002(23) of this title) and under which the survivor annuity is 50 percent of the amount of the annuity which is payable during the joint lives of the participant and the spouse.
  (e) Limitation on distributions other than life annuities paid by plan
    (1) In general
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the fiduciary of a pension plan that is subject to the additional funding requirements of section 1082(d) of this title shall not permit a prohibited payment to be made from a plan during a period in which such plan has a liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 1082(e)(5) of this title).
    (2) Prohibited payment
       For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ””prohibited payment““ means–
      (A) any payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any social security supplements described in the last sentence of section 1054(b)(1)(G) of this title), to a participant or beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in section 1055(h)(2) of this title), that occurs during the period referred to in paragraph (1),
      (B) any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits, and
      (C) any other payment specified by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.
    (3) Period of shortfall
       For purposes of this subsection, a plan has a liquidity shortfall during the period that there is an underpayment of an installment under section 1082(e) of this title by reason of paragraph (5)(A) thereof.
    (4) Coordination with other provisions
       Compliance with this subsection shall not constitute a violation of any other provision of this chapter.
