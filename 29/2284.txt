  (a) Federal share
     The Federal share of the costs described in section 2281(a) of this title shall be not more than 50 percent.
  (b) Requirements
     A State that desires to receive a grant under section 2281 of this title shall include in the application submitted under section 2282 of this title assurances that the State will meet the following requirements regarding funds supporting an alternative funding mechanism assisted under section 2281 of this title:
    (1) The State shall make available the funds necessary to provide the non-Federal share of the costs described in section 2281(a) of this title, in cash, from State, local, or private sources.
    (2) Funds that support an alternative financing mechanism assisted under section 2281 of this titleâ€“
      (A) shall be used to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and local public funds expended to provide public funding options; and
      (B) may only be distributed through the entity carrying out the alternative financing mechanism as a payer of last resort for assistance that is not available in a reasonable or timely fashion from any other Federal, State, or local source.
    (3) All funds that support an alternative financing mechanism assisted under section 2281 of this title, including funds repaid during the life of the mechanism, shall be placed in a permanent separate account and identified and accounted for separately from any other fund. Funds within this account may be invested in low-risk securities in which a regulated insurance company may invest under the law of the State for which the grant is provided and shall be administered with the same judgment and care that a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would exercise in the management of the financial affairs of such person.
    (4) Funds comprised of the principal and interest from an account described in paragraph (3) shall be available to support an alternative financing mechanism assisted under section 2281 of this title. Any interest or investment income that accrues on such funds after such funds have been placed under the control of the entity administering the mechanism, but before such funds are distributed for purposes of supporting the mechanism, shall be the property of the entity administering the mechanism and shall not be taken into account by any officer or employee of the Federal Government for any purpose.
