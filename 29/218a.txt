Any automatic enrollment program shall include adequate notice and the opportunity for an employee to opt out of any coverage the individual or employee were \1\N automatically enrolled in. Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any State law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect any standard or requirement relating to employers in connection with payroll except to the extent that such standard or requirement prevents an employer from instituting the automatic enrollment program under this section.
