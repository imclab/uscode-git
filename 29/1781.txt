  (a) Contractor“s obligations; training program contents
     A contractor subject to the affirmative action obligations of Executive Order 11246, as amended, issued September 24, 1965, may establish or participate in training programs pursuant to this section for individuals meeting the eligibility criteria established in section \1\N 1603, 1643, 1671, and 1672 of this title, which are designed to assist such contractors in meeting the affirmative action obligations of such Executive order. To qualify under this section, such a training program shall contain–
    (1) a description of the jobs in the contractor“s work force or in the service delivery area, for which the contractor has determined there is a need for training;
    (2) a description of the recruiting, training, or other functions that the contractor, or the organization that will be engaged to perform the training, will perform and the steps that will be taken to insure that eligible individuals will–
      (A) be selected for participation in training,
      (B) be trained in necessary skills, and
      (C) be referred for job openings,
     in accordance with the objectives of such Executive order;
    (3) whenever an organization other than the contractor will perform the training, a description of the demonstrated effectiveness of the organization as a provider of employment and training services;
    (4) a description of how the contractor will monitor the program to keep an accurate accounting of all trainees, including (A) whether the trainees successfully complete the training program, and (B) whether the trainees are or are not placed; and
    (5) an estimation of the cost of the program and an assurance that the contractor will assume all costs of the program or the pro rata share of costs to the contractor of the program.
  (b) Review of community-need directed programs; programs includable in performance accomplishments; determination of affirmative action compliance; notice of compliance; abbreviated affirmative action program; successful performance and presumption of good faith effort; limitation; ””successful performance or operation““ defined
    (1)      (A) If the training proposal is designed to meet the needs of the community rather than, or in addition to, the employment needs of the contractor, and has not been approved by another Federal agency, the program shall be submitted to the private industry council established under section 1512 of this title for a determination that there is a need for such training in the community.
      (B) Individuals trained under any program satisfying the requirements of this section may be included by the private industry council in its performance accomplishments and the wage gains of such individuals shall be included in determining the compliance of the job training program of the private industry council with applicable standards.
    (2) The Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor, shall promulgate regulations setting forth how the Office will determine, during a compliance review, the degree to which a training program will satisfy the contractor“s affirmative action obligations. The training and placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor may be considered in evaluating such contractor“s overall good faith efforts, but in no event may placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor be permitted to affect that contractor“s affirmative action obligations respecting its work force. The content of the training program will not be subject to review or regulation by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. If during a compliance review the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs determines that a training program does not comply with its regulations, the Director shall–
      (A) notify the contractor of the disapproval,
      (B) set forth the reasons for the disapproval, and
      (C) provide a list of recommendations which, if accepted, will qualify the training program under this section.
    (3) A contractor who has a training program which contains the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section and which is in accordance with regulations promulgated under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall continue to meet the affirmative action obligations of Executive Order 11246, as amended, but the contractors required to maintain a written affirmative action program need only maintain an abbreviated affirmative action program, the content and length of which shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, to satisfy the written affirmative action program portion of their obligations under Executive Order 11246, as amended. Successful performance or operation of a training program meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall create a presumption that the contractor has made a good faith effort to meet its affirmative action obligations to the degree specified by the Director under paragraph (2) of this subsection, but that presumption shall not be applicable to the satisfaction of other affirmative action obligations not directly related to the training and hiring requirements of this section, or other affirmative action obligations not affected by this section. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, ””successful performance or operation““ means training and placing in jobs a number of individuals which bears a reasonable relationship to the number of job openings in the contractors“s \2\N facilities or in the relevant labor market area.
  (c) Limitations: compulsory program involvement; exclusive compliance criteria; obligations of nonparticipating contractors; interference with private industry councils; restriction of Secretary“s authority; short form affirmative action plan
     Nothing in this section may be interpreted–
    (1) to compel contractor involvement in such programs,
    (2) to establish the exclusive criteria by which a contractor can be found to have fulfilled its affirmative action obligations,
    (3) to provide authority for imposing any additional obligations on contractors not participating in such training activities,
    (4) to permit the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to intervene or interfere with the authority and responsibilities of the private industry councils,
    (5) to restrict or limit the authority of the Secretary to investigate the employment practices of any Government contractor, to initiate such investigation by the Director, to determine whether any nondiscrimination contractual provisions have been violated, or to enforce Executive Order 11246, or
    (6) to prohibit the Secretary or the Director, or other authorized officers of the United States, from requesting or compelling any contractor preparing and maintaining a short form affirmative action plan under subsection (b) of this section to provide information necessary to conduct a compliance review or to provide data necessary to determine whether any violation of Executive Order 11246 has occurred.
