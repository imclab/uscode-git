  (a) In general
    (1) States
      (A) Population basis
         Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this subpart, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 796dâ€“1 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.
      (B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts
         Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of an allotment made to the State for fiscal year 1992 under part A of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.
      (C) Minimums
         Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.
    (2) Certain territories
      (A) In general
         For the purposes of paragraph (1)(C), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau shall not be considered to be States.
      (B) Allotment
         Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this subpart for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.
    (3) Adjustment for inflation
       For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(C) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.
  (b) Proportional reduction
     To provide allotments to States in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, to provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the amount required by subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.
  (c) Reallotment
     Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State in carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
