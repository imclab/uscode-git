  (a) Eligibility
    (1) An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual–
      (A) is an individual with a disability under section 706(8)(A) of this title; and
      (B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, enter, engage in, or retain gainful employment.
    (2) An individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be considered to have–
      (A) a physical or mental impairment which for such individual constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment under section 706(8)(A)(i) of this title; and
      (B) a severe physical or mental impairment which seriously limits one or more functional capacities in terms of an employment outcome under section 706(15)(A)(i) of this title.
    (3) Determinations made by officials of other agencies, particularly the education officials described in section 721(a)(24) of this title, regarding whether an individual satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual is an individual with a disability under section 706(8)(A) of this title or an individual with a severe disability under section 706(15)(A) of this title, shall be used (to the extent appropriate and available and consistent with the requirements under this chapter) for making such determinations under this chapter.
    (4)      (A) It shall be presumed that an individual can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 706(8)(A)(ii) of this title, unless the designated State unit can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome.
      (B) In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A) with respect to cases in which the issue concerns the severity of the disability of an individual, the designated State unit shall first conduct an extended evaluation by providing the services described in subparagraph (C)(iii)(I), and conducting the assessment described in subparagraph (C)(iii)(II), of section 706(22) of this title.
    (5)      (A) The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days after the individual has submitted an application to receive the services unless–
        (i) the designated State unit notifies the individual that exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the agency preclude the agency from completing the determination within the prescribed time and the individual agrees that an extension of time is warranted; or
        (ii) such an extended evaluation is required.
      (B) The determination of eligibility shall be based on the review of existing data described in section 706(22)(A)(i) of this title, and, to the extent necessary, the preliminary assessment described in section 706(22)(A)(ii) of this title.
