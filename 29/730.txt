  (a) Computation; additional amount; minimum amount; adjustments; additional allotment
    (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of (A) the population of the State, and (B) the square of its allotment percentage, bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.
    (2)      (A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
      (B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section 720(b)(1)(A) \1\N of this title for allotment under this section in excess of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A) \1\ of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount equal to the sum of–
        (i) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and the square of its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States; and
        (ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.
    (3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau) under this subsection for any fiscal year which is less than one-third of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A) \1\ of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is greater, shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.
    (4) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1984, for which any amount is appropriated pursuant to section 720(b)(1)(B) \1\ of this title, each State shall receive an allocation (from such appropriated amount) in addition to the allotment to which such State is entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. Such additional allocation shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount so appropriated as that State“s allotment under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection bears to the sum of such allotments of all the States.
    (5) The Republic of Palau may receive allotments or allocations under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.
  (b) Additional payments; authorization of additional appropriations
    (1) If the payment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for a fiscal year is less than the total payments such State received under section 2 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, such State shall be entitled to an additional payment (subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part) equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and the amount so received by it.
    (2) If a State receives as its Federal share under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year less than the applicable Federal share of the expenditure of such State for fiscal year 1972 for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for such State approved under section 721 of this title (including any amount expended by such State for the administration of the State plan but excluding any amount expended by such State from non-Federal sources for construction under such plan), such State shall be entitled to an additional payment for such fiscal year, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part, equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and an amount equal to the applicable Federal share of such expenditure for vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) Any payment attributable to the additional payment to a State under this subsection shall be made only from appropriations specifically made to carry out this subsection, and such additional appropriations are hereby authorized.
  (c) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount
    (1) Not later than forty-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.
    (2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for carrying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.
    (3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State“s allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
  (d) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services
    (1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part D of this subchapter.
    (2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary–
      (A) not less than one-third of one percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount under paragraph (1), for fiscal years 1993 and 1994; and
      (B) not less than one-half of one percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount under paragraph (1), for fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997.
