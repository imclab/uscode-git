  (a) Hearing after denial of assistance or sanction by Secretary
     Whenever any applicant for financial assistance under this chapter is dissatisfied because the Secretary has made a determination not to award financial assistance in whole or in part to such applicant, the applicant may request a hearing before an administrative law judge of the Department of Labor. A similar hearing may also be requested by any recipient upon whom a corrective action or a sanction has been imposed by the Secretary. Except to the extent provided for in section 1551(c) of this title, subsections (d) and (e) of section 1554 of this title, or section 1577 of this title, all other disputes arising under this chapter shall be adjudicated under grievance procedures established by the recipient or under applicable law other than this chapter.
  (b) Time for filing exceptions; final action by Secretary
     The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute final action by the Secretary unless, within 20 days after receipt of the decision of the administrative law judge, a party dissatisfied with the decision or any part thereof has filed exceptions with the Secretary specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken. Any exception not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived. Thereafter the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the final decision of the Secretary unless the Secretary, within 30 days of such filing, has notified the parties that the case has been accepted for review.
  (c) Time for Secretaryâ€œs review
     Any case accepted for review by the Secretary shall be decided within one hundred and eighty days of such acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the final decision of the Secretary.
  (d) Judicial review
     The provisions of section 1578 of this title shall apply to any final action of the Secretary under this section.
