       The Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts with and make payments to individuals and organizations for the cost of conducting recruitment, screening, and selection of eligible applicants for the Job Corps, as provided for in this section.

      (A) there is a reasonable expectation that the individual considered for selection can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in behavior that would prevent other enrollees from receiving the benefit of the Job Corps program or be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships between the Job Corps center to which the individual might be assigned and communities surrounding the Job Corps center;
      (B) the individual manifests a basic understanding of both the rules to which the individual will be subject and of the consequences of failure to observe the rules; and

No individual shall be denied a position in the Job Corps solely on the basis of individual contact with the criminal justice system.
  (c) Assignment plan
    (1) In general
       Every 2 years, the Secretary shall develop and implement an assignment plan for assigning enrollees to Job Corps centers. In developing the plan, the Secretary shall, based on the analysis described in paragraph (2), establish targets, applicable to each Job Corps center, for–

      (C) the capacity and utilization of the Job Corps center, including services provided through the center.
  (d) Assignment of individual enrollees
    (1) In general
       After an individual has been selected for the Job Corps in accordance with the standards and procedures of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section, the enrollee shall be assigned to the Job Corps center that is closest to the home of the enrollee, except that the Secretary may waive this requirement if–
      (A) the enrollee chooses a vocational training program, or requires an English literacy program, that is not available at such center;
      (B) the enrollee would be unduly delayed in participating in the Job Corps program because the closest center is operating at full capacity; or
      (C) the parent or guardian of the enrollee requests assignment of the enrollee to another Job Corps center due to circumstances in the community of the enrollee that would impair prospects for successful participation in the Job Corps program.
    (2) Enrollees who are younger than 18
       An enrollee who is younger than 18 shall not be assigned to a Job Corps center other than the center closest to the home of the enrollee pursuant to paragraph (1) if the parent or guardian of the enrollee objects to the assignment.
