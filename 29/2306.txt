    (2) Minimum State allocation
       No State shall receive an allotment for any fiscal year described in section 2303(b) of this title that is less than 0.5 percent of the total funds appropriated for such fiscal year.
    (3) Timely allocation
      (A) All allotments and allocations under this chapter shall be based on the latest available data and estimates satisfactory to the Secretary.

  (b) Maintenance of effort
    (1) In general
       Except as provided in paragraph (2), a State is entitled to receive its full allocation of funds under section 2303(b) of this title for any fiscal year if the Secretary finds that the aggregate expenditures of public funds within the State with respect to the provision of services for displaced homemakers for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 percent of such aggregate expenditures of public funds for the fiscal year preceding the first fiscal year for which an allocation of funds is made under section 2303(b) of this title.
    (2) Reductions
       The Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allocation of funds under section 2303(b) of this title in any fiscal year in the exact proportion to which the State fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) by falling below 90 percent of the aggregate expenditures of public funds.
    (3) Waiver
       The Secretary may waive, for any fiscal year, the requirements of this subsection if the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.
