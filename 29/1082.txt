  (a) Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiency
    (1) Every employee pension benefit plan subject to this part shall satisfy the minimum funding standard (or the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title) for any plan year to which this part applies. A plan to which this part applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency.
    (2) For the purposes of this part, the term ””accumulated funding deficiency““ means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this part applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.
    (3) In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 1423 of this title.
  (b) Funding standard account
    (1) Each plan to which this part applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.
    (2) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of–
      (A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,
      (B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)–
        (i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 40 plan years,
        (ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 30 plan years,
        (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,
        (iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and
        (v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),
      (C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and
      (D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D).
    (3) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of–
      (A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,
      (B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)–
        (i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,
        (ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and
        (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),
      (C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for the plan year, and
      (D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.
    (4) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be–
      (A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and
      (B) may be off set against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.
    (5) T4Interest.–
      (A) T4In generalK.–The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.
      (B) T4Required change of interest rateK.–For purposes of determining a plan“s current liability and for purposes of determining a plan“s required contribution under subsection (d) of this section for any plan year–
        (i) T4In generalK.–If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.
        (ii) T4Permissible rangeK.–For purposes of this subparagraph–
          (I) T4In generalK.–Except as provided in subclause (II), the term ””permissible range““ means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the the \1\N weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.
          (II) T4Secretarial authorityK.–If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).
        (iii) T4AssumptionsK.–Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i) of this section, the interest rate used under the plan shall be–
          (I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but
          (II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.
    (6) In the case of a plan which, immediately before September 26, 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 1002(37) of this title as in effect immediately before such date)–
      (A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;
      (B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;
      (C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and
      (D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which–
        (i) was adopted before such date, and
        (ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,
       shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the increase arises.
    (7) For purposes of this part–
      (A) Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer“s withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan“s funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.
      (B) If a plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year–
        (i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but
        (ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.
       The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) of title 26 as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.
      (C) Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 1402 of this title or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) of title 26 pursuant to section 1403 of this title shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.
      (D) Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer“s withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
      (E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7) of this section, unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3) of title 26).
  (c) Methods
    (1) For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.
    (2)      (A) For purposes of this part, the value of the plan“s assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
      (B) For purposes of this part, the value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5) of this section.
    (3) For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods–
      (A) in the case of–
        (i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or
        (ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and
      (B) which, in combination, offer the actuary“s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.
    (4) For purposes of this section, if–
      (A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or
      (B) a change in the definition of the term ””wages““ under section 3121 of title 26, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of title 26,
         results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.
    (5)      (A) T4In generalK.–If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
      (B) T4Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement.–
        (i) T4In generalK.–No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (d)(7)(C) of this section) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
        (ii) T4Plans to which subparagraph appliesK.–This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if–
          (I) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which subchapter III of this chapter applies;
          (II) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 1301(a)(13) of this title) and members of such sponsors“ controlled groups (as defined in section 1301(a)(14) of this title) which are covered by subchapter III of this chapter (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000; and
          (III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the unfunded current liability of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.
    (6) If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under section 1085 of this title) in excess of the full funding limitation–
      (A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and
      (B) all amounts described in paragraphs (2), (B), (C), and (D) and (3)(B) of subsection (b) of this section which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such paragraphs.
    (7) T4Full-funding limitation.–
      (A) T4In generalK.–For purposes of paragraph (6), the term ””full-funding limitation““ means the excess (if any) of–
        (i) the lesser of (I) 150 percent of current liability (including the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), or (II) the accrued liability (including normal cost) under the plan (determined under the entry age normal funding method if such accrued liability cannot be directly calculated under the funding method used for the plan), over
        (ii) the lesser of–
          (I) the fair market value of the plan“s assets, or
          (II) the value of such assets determined under paragraph (2).
      (B) T4Current liabilityK.–For purposes of subparagraph (D) and subclause (I) of subparagraph (A)(i), the term ””current liability““ has the meaning given such term by subsection (d)(7) of this section (without regard to subparagraphs (C) and (D) thereof) and using the rate of interest used under subsection (b)(5)(B) of this section.
      (C) T4Special rule for paragraph (6)(b)K.–For purposes of paragraph (6)(B), subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied without regard to subclause (I) thereof.
      (D) T4Regulatory authorityK.–The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide–
        (i) for adjustments to the percentage contained in subparagraph (A)(i) to take into account the respective ages or lengths of service of the participants,
        (ii) alternative methods based on factors other than current liability for the determination of the amount taken into account under subparagraph (A)(i), and
        (iii) for the treatment under this section of contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of subparagraph (A)(i)(I).
      (E) T4Minimum amount.–
        (i) T4In generalK.–In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of–
          (I) 90 percent of the current liability of the plan (including the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), over
          (II) the value of the plan“s assets determined under paragraph (2).
        (ii) T4Current liability; assetsK.–For purposes of clause (i)–
          (I) the term ””current liability““ has the meaning given such term by subsection (d)(7) of this section (without regard to subparagraph (D) thereof), and
          (II) assets shall not be reduced by any credit balance in the funding standard account.
    (8) For purposes of this part, any amendment applying to a plan year which–
      (A) is adopted after the close of such plan year but no later than 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, no later than 2 years after the close of such plan year),
      (B) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the beginning of the first plan year to which the amendment applies, and
      (C) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the time of adoption except to the extent required by the circumstances,
         shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year. No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary notifying him of such amendment and the Secretary has approved such amendment or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary unless he determines that such amendment is necessary because of a substantial business hardship (as determined under section 1083(b) of this title) and that waiver under section 1083(a) of this title is unavailable or inadequate.
    (9) For purposes of this part, a determination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan“s liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (10) For purposes of this section–
      (A) In the case of a defined benefit plan other than a multiemployer plan, any contributions for a plan year made by an employer during the period–
        (i) beginning on the day after the last day of such plan year, and
        (ii) ending on the date which is 8\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year,
       shall be deemed to have been made on such last day.
      (B) In the case of a plan not described in subparagraph (A), any contributions for a plan year made by an employer after the last day of such plan year, but not later than two and one-half months after such day, shall be deemed to have been made on such last day. For purposes of this subparagraph, such two and one-half month period may be extended for not more than six months under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (11) T4Liability for contributions.–
      (A) T4In generalK.–Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of any contribution required by this section and any required installments under subsection (e) of this section shall be paid by the employer responsible for contributing to or under the plan the amount described in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section.

    (12) T4Anticipation of benefit increases effective in the futureK.–In determining projected benefits, the funding method of a collectively bargained plan described in section 413(a) of title 26 (other than a multiemployer plan) shall anticipate benefit increases scheduled to take effect during the term of the collective bargaining agreement applicable to the plan.
  (d) Additional funding requirements for plans which are not multiemployer plans
    (1) In general
       In the case of a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which this subsection applies under paragraph (9) for any plan year, the amount charged to the funding standard account for such plan year shall be increased by the sum of–
      (A) the excess (if any) of–
        (i) the deficit reduction contribution determined under paragraph (2) for such plan year, over
        (ii) the sum of the charges for such plan year under subsection (b)(2) of this section, reduced by the sum of the credits for such plan year under subparagraph (B) of subsection (b)(3) of this section, plus
      (B) the unpredictable contingent event amount (if any) for such plan year.
       Such increase shall not exceed the amount which, after taking into account charges (other than the additional charge under this subsection) and credits under subsection (b) of this section, is necessary to increase the funded current liability percentage (taking into account the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year) to 100 percent.
    (2) Deficit reduction contribution
       For purposes of paragraph (1), the deficit reduction contribution determined under this paragraph for any plan year is the sum of–
      (A) the unfunded old liability amount,

      (B) Unfunded old liability
         The term ””unfunded old liability““ means the unfunded current liability of the plan as of the beginning of the 1st plan year beginning after December 31, 1987 (determined without regard to any plan amendment increasing liabilities adopted after October 16, 1987).

        (i) In general
           In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and the employer ratified before October 29, 1987, the unfunded old liability amount with respect to such plan for any plan year shall be increased by the amount necessary to amortize the unfunded existing benefit increase liability in equal annual installments over a period of 18 plan years beginning with–
          (I) the plan year in which the benefit increase with respect to such liability occurs, or
          (II) if the taxpayer elects, the 1st plan year beginning after December 31, 1988.
        (ii) Unfunded existing benefit increase liabilities
           For purposes of clause (i), the unfunded existing benefit increase liability means, with respect to any benefit increase under the agreements described in clause (i) which takes effect during or after the 1st plan year beginning after December 31, 1987, the unfunded current liability determined–
          (I) by taking into account only liabilities attributable to such benefit increase, and
          (II) by reducing (but not below zero) the amount determined under paragraph (8)(A)(ii) by the current liability determined without regard to such benefit increase.
        (iii) Extensions, modifications, etc. not taken into account
           For purposes of this subparagraph, any extension, amendment, or other modification of an agreement after October 28, 1987, shall not be taken into account.
      (D) Special rule for required changes in actuarial assumptions
        (i) In general
           The unfunded old liability amount with respect to any plan for any plan year shall be increased by the amount necessary to amortize the amount of additional unfunded old liability under the plan in equal annual installments over a period of 12 plan years (beginning with the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994).
        (ii) Additional unfunded old liability
           For purposes of clause (i), the term ””additional unfunded old liability““ means the amount (if any) by which–
          (I) the current liability of the plan as of the beginning of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994, valued using the assumptions required by paragraph (7)(C) as in effect for plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, exceeds
          (II) the current liability of the plan as of the beginning of such first plan year, valued using the same assumptions used under subclause (I) (other than the assumptions required by paragraph (7)(C)), using the prior interest rate, and using such mortality assumptions as were used to determine current liability for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1992.
        (iii) Prior interest rate
           For purposes of clause (ii), the term ””prior interest rate““ means the rate of interest that is the same percentage of the weighted average under subsection (b)(5)(B)(ii)(I) of this section for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994, as the rate of interest used by the plan to determine current liability for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1992, is of the weighted average under subsection (b)(5)(B)(ii)(I) of this section for such first plan year beginning after December 31, 1992.
      (E) Optional rule for additional unfunded old liability
        (i) In general
           If an employer makes an election under clause (ii), the additional unfunded old liability for purposes of subparagraph (D) shall be the amount (if any) by which–
          (I) the unfunded current liability of the plan as of the beginning of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994, valued using the assumptions required by paragraph (7)(C) as in effect for plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, exceeds
          (II) the unamortized portion of the unfunded old liability under the plan as of the beginning of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994.
        (ii) Election
          (I) An employer may irrevocably elect to apply the provisions of this subparagraph as of the beginning of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1994.
          (II) If an election is made under this clause, the increase under paragraph (1) for any plan year beginning after December 31, 1994, and before January 1, 2002, to which this subsection applies (without regard to this subclause) shall not be less than the increase that would be required under paragraph (1) if the provisions of this subchapter as in effect for the last plan year beginning before January 1, 1995, had remained in effect.
    (4) Unfunded new liability amount
       For purposes of this subsection–
      (A) In general
         The unfunded new liability amount with respect to any plan for any plan year is the applicable percentage of the unfunded new liability.
