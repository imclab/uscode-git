  (a) Congressional findings; purpose; policy
    (1) Congress finds that–
      (A) work–
        (i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and
        (ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America;
      (B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;
      (C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;
      (D) reasons for the significant number of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at a level not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include–
        (i) discrimination;
        (ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;
        (iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing existing private health insurance; and
        (iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to enter or retain or advance in employment;
      (E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities; and
      (F) the provision of vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities.
    (2) The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating a comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable program of vocational rehabilitation that is designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.
    (3) It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:
      (A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.
      (B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated settings.
      (C) Individuals with disabilities must be active participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making meaningful and informed choices about the selection of their vocational goals and objectives and the vocational rehabilitation services they receive.
      (D) Families and natural supports can play an important role in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability requests, desires, or needs such supports.
      (E) Qualified vocational rehabilitation counselors, other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment goals and objectives of an individual.
      (F) Individuals with disabilities and their advocates are full partners in the vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.
      (G) Accountability measures must facilitate and not impede the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most severe disabilities.
  (b) Authorization of appropriations
    (1) For the purpose of making grants to States under part B of this subchapter (other than grants under section 732 of this title) to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1997, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this subsection for the immediately preceding fiscal year, plus the amount of the Consumer Price Index addition determined under subsection (c) of this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
    (2) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out part C of this subchapter such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1997.
  (c) Percentage change in Consumer Price Index; publication in Federal Register; increase in appropriations
    (1) No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.
    (2)      (A) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.
      (B) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).
    (3) For purposes of this section, the term ””Consumer Price Index““ means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  (d) Extension of program authorization or duration; appropriation
    (1)      (A) Unless the Congress in the regular session which ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year–
        (i) of the authorization of appropriations for the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter; or
        (ii) of the duration of the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter;
           has passed legislation which would have the effect of extending the authorization or duration (as the case may be) of such program, such authorization is automatically extended for one additional year for the program authorized by this subchapter.
      (B) The amount authorized to be appropriated for the additional fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to the amount appropriated for such program for fiscal year 1997, plus the amount of the Consumer Price Index addition determined under subsection (c) of this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
    (2)      (A) For the purposes of subdivision (i) of paragraph (1), the Congress shall not have been deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.
