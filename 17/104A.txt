        (ii)          (I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register;
          (II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the 12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued after the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall be available only for infringement occurring after the end of that 12-month period; or

      (ii) before the date on which the source country of the restored work becomes an eligible country, if that country is not an eligible country on such date of enactment,
     a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for the duration of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner of the restored copyright reasonable compensation for conduct which would be subject to a remedy for infringement but for the provisions of this paragraph.
  (B) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the amount of such compensation shall be determined by an action in United States district court, and shall reflect any harm to the actual or potential market for or value of the restored work from the reliance party“s continued exploitation of the work, as well as compensation for the relative contributions of expression of the author of the restored work and the reliance party to the derivative work.

If the notice is signed by an agent, the agency relationship must have been constituted in writing and signed by the owner before service of the notice.
  (3) T4Effect of material false statementsK.–Any material false statement knowingly made with respect to any restored copyright identified in any notice of intent shall make void all claims and assertions made with respect to such restored copyright.
