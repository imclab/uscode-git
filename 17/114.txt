The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1) and (2) of section 106 do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds, even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording. The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1), (2), and (3) of section 106 do not apply to sound recordings included in educational television and radio programs (as defined in section 397 of title 47) distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities (as defined by section 118(g)): T3ProvidedK, That copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.

        (ii) an initial nonsubscription retransmission made for direct reception by members of the public of a prior or simultaneous incidental transmission that is not made for direct reception by members of the public; or
        (iii) a nonsubscription broadcast transmission;
      (B) a retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast transmission: T3ProvidedK, That, in the case of a retransmission of a radio station“s broadcast transmission–

          (I) the 150 mile limitation under this clause shall not apply when a nonsubscription broadcast transmission by a radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission is retransmitted on a nonsubscription basis by a terrestrial broadcast station, terrestrial translator, or terrestrial repeater licensed by the Federal Communications Commission; and
          (II) in the case of a subscription retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast retransmission covered by subclause (I), the 150 mile radius shall be measured from the transmitter site of such broadcast retransmitter;
        (ii) the retransmission is of radio station broadcast transmissions that are–
          (I) obtained by the retransmitter over the air;
          (II) not electronically processed by the retransmitter to deliver separate and discrete signals; and
          (III) retransmitted only within the local communities served by the retransmitter;

        (iv) the radio station“s broadcast transmission is made by a noncommercial educational broadcast station funded on or after January 1, 1995, under section 396(k) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 396(k)), consists solely of noncommercial educational and cultural radio programs, and the retransmission, whether or not simultaneous, is a nonsubscription terrestrial broadcast retransmission; or

      (D) The performance of a sound recording by means of a retransmission of a digital audio transmission is not an infringement of section 106(6) if–
        (i) the retransmission is of a transmission by an interactive service licensed to publicly perform the sound recording to a particular member of the public as part of that transmission; and

      (A) 2\1/2\ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether or not members of the American Federation of Musicians) who have performed on sound recordings.

      (C) 45 percent of the receipts shall be allocated, on a per sound recording basis, to the recording artist or artists featured on such sound recording (or the persons conveying rights in the artists“ performance in the sound recordings).
  (h) T4Licensing to Affiliates.–

    (2) The limitation set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply in the case where the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses–
      (A) an interactive service; or
      (B) an entity to perform publicly up to 45 seconds of the sound recording and the sole purpose of the performance is to promote the distribution or performance of that sound recording.
        (i) T4No Effect on Royalties for Underlying WorksK.–License fees payable for the public performance of sound recordings under section 106(6) shall not be taken into account in any administrative, judicial, or other governmental proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable to copyright owners of musical works for the public performance of their works. It is the intent of Congress that royalties payable to copyright owners of musical works for the public performance of their works shall not be diminished in any respect as a result of the rights granted by section 106(6).
        (j) T4DefinitionsK.–As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
          (1) An ””affiliated entity““ is an entity engaging in digital audio transmissions covered by section 106(6), other than an interactive service, in which the licensor has any direct or indirect partnership or any ownership interest amounting to 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting or non-voting stock.
          (2) A ””broadcast““ transmission is a transmission made by a terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission.
          (3) A ””digital audio transmission““ is a digital transmission as defined in section 101, that embodies the transmission of a sound recording. This term does not include the transmission of any audiovisual work.
          (4) An ””interactive service““ is one that enables a member of the public to receive, on request, a transmission of a particular sound recording chosen by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed for reception by the public at large does not make a service interactive. If an entity offers both interactive and non-interactive services (either concurrently or at different times), the non-interactive component shall not be treated as part of an interactive service.
          (5) A ””nonsubscription““ transmission is any transmission that is not a subscription transmission.
          (6) A ””retransmission““ is a further transmission of an initial transmission, and includes any further retransmission of the same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmission qualifies as a ””retransmission““ only if it is simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify for an exemption under section 114(d)(1).
          (7) The ””sound recording performance complement““ is the transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel used by a transmitting entity, of no more than–
            (A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord lawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the United States, if no more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; or
            (B) 4 different selections of sound recordings–
              (i) by the same featured recording artist; or
              (ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States,
             if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively:
           T3ProvidedK, That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance complement if the programming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.
          (8) A ””subscription““ transmission is a transmission that is controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission.
          (9) A ””transmission““ includes both an initial transmission and a retransmission.
