  (b) T4Form of NoticeK.–If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the following three elements:
    (1) the symbol G6T1©K (the letter C in a circle), or the word ””Copyright““, or the abbreviation ””Copr.““; and
    (2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations, or derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and
