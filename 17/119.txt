  (D) T4Outside the predicted grade b contourK.–(i) If a network station challenges whether a subscriber is an unserved household outside the predicted Grade B Contour of the station, the station may conduct a measurement of the signal intensity of the subscriber“s household to determine whether the household is an unserved household after giving reasonable notice to the satellite carrier of the network station“s intent to conduct the measurement.
  (ii) If the network station conducts a signal intensity measurement under clause (i) and the measurement indicates that–
    (I) the household is not an unserved household, the station shall forward the results to the satellite carrier who shall, within 60 days after receipt of the measurement, terminate the service to the household of the signal that is the subject of the challenge, and shall reimburse the station for the costs of the measurement within 60 days after receipt of the measurement results and a statement of such costs; or
    (II) the household is an unserved household, the station shall pay the costs of the measurement.
  (9) T4Loser pays for signal intensity measurement; recovery of measurement costs in a civil actionK.–In any civil action filed relating to the eligibility of subscribing households as unserved households–
    (A) a network station challenging such eligibility shall, within 60 days after receipt of the measurement results and a statement of such costs, reimburse the satellite carrier for any signal intensity measurement that is conducted by that carrier in response to a challenge by the network station and that establishes the household is an unserved household; and
    (B) a satellite carrier shall, within 60 days after receipt of the measurement results and a statement of such costs, reimburse the network station challenging such eligibility for any signal intensity measurement that is conducted by that station and that establishes the household is not an unserved household.

      (B) a royalty fee for that 6-month period, computed by–
        (i) multiplying the total number of subscribers receiving each secondary transmission of a superstation during each calendar month by 17.5 cents per subscriber in the case of superstations not subject to syndicated exclusivity under the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and 14 cents per subscriber in the case of superstations subject to such syndicated exclusivity;
        (ii) multiplying the number of subscribers receiving each secondary transmission of a network station during each calendar month by 6 cents; and

The parties to each negotiation proceeding shall bear the entire cost thereof.
      (C) T4Agreements binding on parties; filing of agreementsK.–Voluntary agreements negotiated at any time in accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon all satellite carriers, distributors, and copyright owners that are parties thereto.

The fee shall also be calculated to achieve the following objectives:
        (i) To maximize the availability of creative works to the public.
        (ii) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his or her creative work and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions.
        (iii) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright user in the product made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost, risk, and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative expression and media for their communication.

      (D) \2\ T4Establishment of royalty feesK.–In determining royalty fees under this paragraph, the Copyright Arbitration Panel shall establish fees for the retransmission of network stations and superstations that most clearly represent the fair market value of secondary transmissions. In determining the fair market value, the Panel shall base its decision on economic, competitive, and programming information presented by the parties, including–
        (i) the competitive environment in which such programming is distributed, the cost for similar signals in similar private and compulsory license marketplaces, and any special features and conditions of the retransmission marketplace;
