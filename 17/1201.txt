The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall take effect at the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this chapter.
  (B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to persons who are users of a copyrighted work which is in a particular class of works, if such persons are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by virtue of such prohibition in their ability to make noninfringing uses of that particular class of works under this title, as determined under subparagraph (C).
  (C) During the 2-year period described in subparagraph (A), and during each succeeding 3-year period, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who shall consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce and report and comment on his or her views in making such recommendation, shall make the determination in a rulemaking proceeding for purposes of subparagraph (B) of whether persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their ability to make noninfringing uses under this title of a particular class of copyrighted works. In conducting such rulemaking, the Librarian shall examine–
    (i) the availability for use of copyrighted works;

          (B) from a copy of a transmission of a live event or an audiovisual work if such transmission is provided by a channel or service where payment is made by a member of the public for such channel or service in the form of a subscription fee that entitles the member of the public to receive all of the programming contained in such channel or service;
          (C) from a physical medium containing one or more prerecorded audiovisual works; or
          (D) from a copy of a transmission described in subparagraph (A) or from a copy made from a physical medium described in subparagraph (C).
         In the event that a transmission meets both the conditions set forth in subparagraph (A) and those set forth in subparagraph (B), the transmission shall be treated as a transmission described in subparagraph (A).
        (3) T4InapplicabilityK.–This subsection shall not–

          (A) An ””analog video cassette recorder““ means a device that records, or a device that includes a function that records, on electromagnetic tape in an analog format the electronic impulses produced by the video and audio portions of a television program, motion picture, or other form of audiovisual work.
          (B) An ””analog video cassette camcorder““ means an analog video cassette recorder that contains a recording function that operates through a camera lens and through a video input that may be connected with a television or other video playback device.
          (C) An analog video cassette recorder ””conforms““ to the automatic gain control copy control technology if it–
            (i) detects one or more of the elements of such technology and does not record the motion picture or transmission protected by such technology; or
            (ii) records a signal that, when played back, exhibits a meaningfully distorted or degraded display.
          (D) The term ””professional analog video cassette recorder““ means an analog video cassette recorder that is designed, manufactured, marketed, and intended for use by a person who regularly employs such a device for a lawful business or industrial use, including making, performing, displaying, distributing, or transmitting copies of motion pictures on a commercial scale.
          (E) The terms ””VHS format““, ””8mm format““, ””Beta format““, ””automatic gain control copy control technology““, ””colorstripe copy control technology““, ””four-line version of the colorstripe copy control technology““, and ””NTSC““ have the meanings that are commonly understood in the consumer electronics and motion picture industries as of the date of the enactment of this chapter.
        (5) T4ViolationsK.–Any violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be treated as a violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section. Any violation of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be deemed an ””act of circumvention““ for the purposes of section 1203(c)(3)(A) of this chapter.
