   Neither the ownership limitations of this subchapter nor the ownership limitations of any other provision of Federal reclamation law shall apply to lands which are isolated tracts found by the Secretary to be economically farmable only if they are included in a larger farming operation but which may, as a result of their inclusion in that operation, cause it to exceed such ownership limitations.
