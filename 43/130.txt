   Public lands situated in States in which there are no land offices may be entered at the Bureau of Land Management, subject to the provisions of law touching the entry of public lands; and the necessary proofs and affidavits required in such cases may be made before some officer competent to administer oaths, whose official character shall be duly certified by the clerk of a court of record. And moneys received by the Secretary of the Interior, or such officer as he may designate, for lands entered by cash entry shall be covered into the Treasury.
