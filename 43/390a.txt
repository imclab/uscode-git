   No part of any appropriation shall be available for the initiation of construction under the terms of reclamation law of any dam or reservoir or water supply, or any tunnel, canal or conduit for water, or water distribution system related to such dam or reservoir until the Secretary shall certify to the Congress that an adequate soil survey and land classification has been made and that the lands to be irrigated are susceptible to the production of agricultural crops by means of irrigation or that the successful irrigability of those lands and their susceptibility to sustained production of agricultural crops by means of irrigation has been demonstrated in practice. Such surveys shall include an investigation of soil characteristics which might result in toxic or hazardous irrigation return flows.
