   Irrigable lands owned by States, political subdivisions, and agencies thereof which do not fall within the provisions of section 425 of this title may receive water from a Federal reclamation project, division, or unit if a valid recordable contract for the sale of such lands within ten years of the date of said contract has been executed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior but without limitation upon selling price.
   The purchasers of lands sold under the provisions of this section, or the heirs and devisees of such purchasers, if otherwise eligible under reclamation law to receive project water for the lands purchased, shall not be disqualified for delivery of water by reason of the amount of the purchase price paid for said lands.
