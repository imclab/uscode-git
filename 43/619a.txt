         First: Meeting Arizona“s first priority right to delivery of excess energy which is equal in each year of operation to 200 million kilowatthours: T3Provided, howeverK, That in the event excess energy in the amount of 200 million kilowatthours is not generated during any year of operation, Arizona shall accumulate a first right to delivery of excess energy subsequently generated in an amount not to exceed 600 million kilowatthours, inclusive of the current year“s 200 million kilowatthours. Said first right of delivery shall accrue at a rate of 200 million kilowatthours per year for each year excess energy in the amount of 200 million kilowatthours is not generated, less amounts of excess energy deliveredDArizona  
         Second: Meeting Hoover Dam contractual obligations under schedule A of subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section and under schedule B of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section not exceeding 26 million kilowatthours in each year of operationD........................
         Third: Meeting the energy requirements of the three States, such available excess energy to be divided equally among the StatesDArizona, Nevada, California
    (2) The total obligation of the Secretary of Energy to deliver firm energy pursuant to schedule A of subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section and schedule B of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section is 4,527.001 million kilowatthours in each year of operation. To the extent that the actual generation at Hoover Powerplant in any year of operation (less deliveries thereof to Arizona required by its first priority under schedule C of subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section whenever actual generation in any year of operation is in excess of 4,501.001 million kilowatthours) is less than 4,527.001 million kilowatthours, such deficiency shall be borne by the holders of contracts under said schedules A and B in the ratio that the sum of the quantities of firm energy to which each contractor is entitled pursuant to said schedules bears to 4,527.001 million kilowatthours. At the request of any such contractor, the Secretary of Energy will purchase energy to meet that contractor“s deficiency at such contractor“s expense.
    (3) Subdivision E of the ””General Consolidated Power Marketing Criteria or Regulations for Boulder City Area Projects““ published in the Federal Register May 9, 1983 (48 Federal Register commencing at 20881), hereinafter referred to as the ””Criteria““ or as the ””Regulations““ shall be deemed to have been modified to conform to this section. The Secretary of Energy shall cause to be included in the Federal Register a notice conforming the text of said Regulations to such modifications.
    (4) Each contract offered under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall:
      (A) expire September 30, 2017;
      (B) not restrict use to which the capacity and energy contracted for by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California may be placed within the State of California: T3ProvidedK, That to the extent practicable and consistent with sound water management and conservation practice, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall use such capacity and energy to pump available Colorado River water prior to using such capacity and energy to pump California State water project water; and
      (C) conform to the applicable provisions of subdivison \1\N E of the Criteria, commencing at 48 Federal Register 20881, modified as provided in this section. To the extent that said provisions of the Criteria, as so modified, are applicable to contracts entered into under this section, those provisions are hereby ratified.
  (b) Prejudice of rights of contract holders under Boulder Canyon Project Act
     Nothing in the Criteria shall be construed to prejudice any rights conferred by the Boulder Canyon Project Act, as amended and supplemented [43 U.S.C. 617 et seq.], on the holder of a contract described in subsection (a) of this section not in default thereunder on September 30, 2017.
  (c) Execution of contract with parties to certain litigation; offer of contract to other entities
    (1) The Secretary of Energy shall not execute a contract described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section with any entity which is a party to the action entitled the ””State of Nevada, et al. against the United States of America, et al.““ in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, case numbered CV LV ”82 441 RDF, unless that entity agrees to file in that action a stipulation for voluntary dismissal with prejudice of its claims, or counterclaims, or crossclaims, as the case may be, and also agrees to file with the Secretary a document releasing the United States, its officers and agents, and all other parties to that action who join in that stipulation from any claims arising out of the disposition under this section of capacity and energy from the Boulder Canyon project. The Attorney General shall join on behalf of the United States, its officers and agents, in any such voluntary dismissal and shall have the authority to approve on behalf of the United States the form of each release.
    (2) If after a reasonable period of time as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary is precluded from executing a contract with an entity by reason of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall offer the capacity and energy thus available to other entities in the same State eligible to enter into such contracts under section 5 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act [43 U.S.C. 617d].
  (d) Funding of uprating program
     The uprating program authorized under section 619(a) of this title shall be undertaken with funds advanced under contracts made with the Secretary of the Interior by non-Federal purchasers described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.

This section constitutes the exclusive method for disposing of capacity and energy from Hoover Dam for the period beginning June 1, 1987, and ending September 30, 2017.
  (h) Court challenges; disputes and disagreements
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim that the provisions of subsection (a) of this section violates any rights to capacity or energy from the Boulder Canyon project is barred unless the complaint is filed within one year after August 17, 1984, in the United States Court of Federal Claims which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over this action. Any claim that actions taken by any administrative agency of the United States violates any right under this subchapter or the Boulder Canyon Project Act [43 U.S.C. 617 et seq.] or the Boulder Canyon Project Adjustment Act [43 U.S.C. 618 et seq.] is barred unless suit asserting such claim is filed in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction within one year after final refusal of such agency to correct the action complained of.
