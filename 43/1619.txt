    (1) No claim shall be allowed if the claimant has otherwise been reimbursed.
    (2) The amount allowed for services shall be based on the nature of the service rendered, the time and labor required, the need for providing the service, whether the service was intended to be a voluntary public service or compensable, the existence of a bona fide attorney-client relationship with an identified client, and the relationship of the service rendered to the enactment of proposed legislation.

In the discretion of the Chief Commissioner or his designate, hearings may be held in the localities where the claimants reside if convenience so demands.
    (8) Each trial commissioner and each review panel shall have authority to do and perform any acts which may be necessary or proper for the efficient performance of their duties, and shall have the power of subpena, the power to order audit of books and records, and the power to administer oaths and affirmations. Any sanction authorized by the rules of practice of the Court of Claims, except contempt, may be imposed on any claimant, witness, or attorney by the trial commissioner, review panel, or Chief Commissioner. None of the rules, regulations, rulings, findings, or conclusions authorized by this section shall be subject to judicial review.
    (9) The findings and conclusions of the trial commissioner shall be submitted by him, together with the record in the case, to the review panel of commissioners for review by it pursuant to such rules as may be provided for the purpose, which shall include provision for submitting the decision of the trial commissioner to the claimant and any party contesting the claim for consideration, exception, and argument before the panel.
