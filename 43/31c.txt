       The Survey shall be the lead Federal agency responsible for planning, developing national priorities and standards for, coordinating, and managing the geologic mapping program. In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall–
      (A) develop a 5-year strategic plan for the geologic mapping program in accordance with section 31e of this title, which plan shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 1 year after December 9, 1999;
      (B) appoint, with the advice and consultation of the Association, the advisory committee not later than 1 year after December 9, 1999, in accordance with section 31d of this title; and
      (C) not later than 3 years after December 9, 1999, and biennially thereafter, submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives identifying–
        (i) how the Survey and the Association are coordinating the development and implementation of the geologic mapping program;
        (ii) how the Survey and the Association establish goals, mapping priorities, and target dates for implementation of the geologic mapping program; and
        (iii) how long-term staffing plans for the various components of the geologic mapping program affect successful implementation of the geologic mapping program.
    (2) Responsibilities of the Secretary
       In addition to paragraph (1), the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be responsible for developing, as soon as practicable–
      (A) in cooperation with the Association, other Federal and State agencies, public and private sector organizations and academia, the geologic-map data base; and
      (B) maps and mapping techniques which achieve the objectives specified in subsection (c) of this section.
  (c) Program objectives
     The objectives of the geologic mapping program shall include–
    (1) determining the Nation“s geologic framework through systematic development of geologic maps at scales appropriate to the geologic setting and the perceived applications, such maps to be contributed to the national geologic map data base;
    (2) development of a complementary national geophysical-map data base, geochemical-map data base, and a geochronologic and paleontologic data base that provide value-added descriptive and interpretative information to the geologic-map data base;
    (3) application of cost-effective mapping techniques that assemble, produce, translate and disseminate geologic-map information and that render such information of greater application and benefit to the public; and
    (4) development of public awareness of the role and application of geologic-map information to the resolution of national issues of land use management.
  (d) Program components
    (1) Federal component
      (A) In general
         The geologic mapping program shall include a Federal geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to determine the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of the United States.
      (B) Mapping priorities
         For the Federal component, mapping priorities–
        (i) shall be described in the 5-year plan under section 31e of this title; and
        (ii) shall be based on–
          (I) national requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need; and
          (II) national requirements for geologic map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems.
      (C) Interdisciplinary studies
        (i) In general
           The Federal component shall include interdisciplinary studies that add value to geologic mapping.
        (ii) Representative categories
           Interdisciplinary studies under clause (i) may include–
          (I) establishment of a national geologic map database under section 31f of this title;
          (II) studies that lead to the implementation of cost-effective digital methods for the acquisition, compilation, analysis, cartographic production, and dissemination of geologic map information;
          (III) paleontologic, geochrono-logic, and isotopic investigations that provide information critical to understanding the age and history of geologic map units;
          (IV) geophysical investigations that assist in delineating and mapping the physical characteristics and 3-dimensional distribution of geologic materials and geologic structures; and
          (V) geochemical investigations and analytical operations that characterize the composition of geologic map units.
        (iii) Use of results
           The results of investigations under clause (ii) shall be contributed to national databases.
    (2) State component
      (A) In general
         The geologic mapping program shall include a State geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to establish the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of individual States.
      (B) Mapping priorities
         For the State component, mapping priorities–
        (i) shall be determined by State panels representing a broad range of users of geologic maps; and
        (ii) shall be based on–
          (I) State requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need; and
          (II) State requirements for geologic map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems.
      (C) Integration of Federal and State priorities
         A national panel including representatives of the Survey shall integrate the State mapping priorities under this paragraph with the Federal mapping priorities under paragraph (1).
      (D) Use of funds
         The Survey and recipients of grants under the State component shall not use more than 15.25 percent of the Federal funds made available under the State component for any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management charges.
      (E) Federal share
         The Federal share of the cost of activities under the State component for any fiscal year shall not exceed 50 percent.
    (3) Education component
      (A) In general
         The geologic mapping program shall include a geologic mapping education component for the training of geologic mappers, the objectives of which shall be–
        (i) to provide for broad education in geologic mapping and field analysis through support of field studies; and
        (ii) to develop academic programs that teach students of earth science the fundamental principles of geologic mapping and field analysis.
      (B) Investigations
         The education component may include the conduct of investigations, which–
        (i) shall be integrated with the Federal component and the State component; and
        (ii) shall respond to mapping priorities identified for the Federal component and the State component.
      (C) Use of funds
         The Survey and recipients of grants under the education component shall not use more than 15.25 percent of the Federal funds made available under the education component for any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management charges.
