  (d) Feasibility study criteria
    (1) In general
       Not later than 18 months after December 22, 2006, the Secretary shall promulgate criteria (including the feasibility factors listed under subsection (c)) under which the feasibility studies shall be assessed for completeness and appropriateness.
    (2) Inclusions
       The Secretary shall include in the criteria promulgated under paragraph (1) methods to scale the level of effort needed to complete the feasibility assessment relative to the total size and cost of the proposed rural water supply project and reduce total costs to non-Federal entities.
  (e) Feasibility report
    (1) \1\N In general
       After completion of appropriate feasibility studies for rural water supply projects that address the factors described in subsection (c) and the criteria promulgated under subsection (d), the Secretary shall–
      (A) develop a feasibility report that includes–
        (i) a recommendation of the Secretary on–
          (I) whether the rural water supply project should be authorized for construction; and
          (II) the appropriate non-Federal share of construction costs, which shall be–
            (aa) at least 25 percent of the total construction costs; and
            (bb) determined based on an analysis of the capability-to-pay information considered under subsections (c)(9) and (f); and
        (ii) if the Secretary recommends that the project should be authorized for construction–
          (I) what amount of grants, loan guarantees, or combination of grants and loan guarantees should be used to provide the Federal cost share;
          (II) a schedule that identifies the annual operations, maintenance, and replacement costs that should be allocated to each non-Federal entity participating in the rural water supply project; and

      (B) recommend an appropriate Federal share and non-Federal share of the capital construction costs, as determined by the Secretary.
    (2) Factors
       In determining the financial capability of non-Federal project entities to pay for a rural water supply project under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall evaluate factors for the project area, relative to the State average, including–

    (3) Indian tribes
       In determining the capability-to-pay of Indian tribe project beneficiaries, the Secretary may consider deferring the collection of all or part of the non-Federal construction costs apportioned to Indian tribe project beneficiaries unless or until the Secretary determines that the Indian tribe project beneficiaries should pay–
      (A) the costs allocated to the beneficiaries; or
      (B) an appropriate portion of the costs.
  (g) Cost-sharing requirement
    (1) In general
       Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Federal share of the cost of a feasibility study carried out under this section shall not exceed 50 percent of the study costs.
