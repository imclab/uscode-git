     The Secretary may establish and maintain, and regulate the use of, stock driveways in districts and may charge a fee for or permit the free use of such driveways.
  (b) Grazing of livestock free of charge
     The Secretary may permit any person, including prospectors and miners, to graze free of charge a small number of livestock upon any land included within any grazing district.
  (c) Grazing allotments to Eskimos or other native or half-breed
     The Secretary may in his discretion grant a permit or lease for a grazing allotment without charge on unallotted public lands to any Eskimo or other native or half-breed.
