   If the person entitled to compensation disputes the amount of just compensation determined by the Secretary of Transportation under this chapter, the Secretary shall pay the person, as a tentative advance, 75 percent of the amount determined. The person may bring a civil action against the United States to recover just compensation. If the tentative advance paid under this section is greater than the amount of the courtâ€œs judgment, the person shall refund the difference.
