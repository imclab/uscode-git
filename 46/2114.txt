      (B) the seaman has refused to perform duties ordered by the seaman“s employer because the seaman has a reasonable apprehension or expectation that performing such duties would result in serious injury to the seaman, other seamen, or the public;
      (C) the seaman testified in a proceeding brought to enforce a maritime safety law or regulation prescribed under that law;
      (D) the seaman notified, or attempted to notify, the vessel owner or the Secretary of a work-related personal injury or work-related illness of a seaman;

      (G) the seaman accurately reported hours of duty under this part.
    (2) The circumstances causing a seaman“s apprehension of serious injury under paragraph (1)(B) must be of such a nature that a reasonable person, under similar circumstances, would conclude that there is a real danger of an injury or serious impairment of health resulting from the performance of duties as ordered by the seaman“s employer.
    (3) To qualify for protection against the seaman“s employer under paragraph (1)(B), the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.
  (b) A seaman alleging discharge or discrimination in violation of subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the seaman“s request, may file a complaint with respect to such allegation in the same manner as a complaint may be filed under subsection (b) of section 31105 of title 49. Such complaint shall be subject to the procedures, requirements, and rights described in that section, including with respect to the right to file an objection, the right of a person to file for a petition for review under subsection (c) of that section, and the requirement to bring a civil action under subsection (d) of that section.
