    (1) to the seaman“s grandparents, parents, spouse, sister, brother, or children;
    (2) to an agency designated by the Secretary of the Treasury to handle applications for United States savings bonds, to purchase bonds for the seaman; and
    (3) for deposits to be made in an account for savings or investment opened by the seaman and maintained in the seaman“s name at a savings bank or a savings institution in which the accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
  (b) An allotment is valid only if made in writing and signed by and approved by a shipping commissioner.

  (e) This section applies to a foreign vessel when in waters of the United States. An owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, or master of a foreign vessel violating this section is liable to the Government for the same penalty as an owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, or master of a vessel of the United States for the same violation.
