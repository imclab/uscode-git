    (1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;
    (2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels, and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;

    (4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;
    (5) the Secretary has not determined that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;
    (6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and
    (7) the Secretary has considered the criteria specified in section 53708(a)(3)–(5) of this title.
