  (a) When a Reserve officer is promoted to the next higher grade under this subchapter, the date of rank shall be the date of appointment in that grade, unless the promotion was determined in accordance with a running mate system, in which event the same date of rank shall be assigned as that assigned to the officer“s running mate. A Reserve officer so promoted shall be allowed the pay and allowances of the higher grade for duty performed from the date of the officer“s appointment thereto.

  (c) For the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the date of appointment shall be that date when promotion authority is exercised by the Secretary. However, the Secretary may adjust the date of appointment–
    (1) if a delay in the finding required under section 734(a) of this title is beyond the control of the officer and the officer is otherwise qualified for promotion; or
    (2) for any other reason that equity requires.
