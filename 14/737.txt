   Notwithstanding any other law, if a Reserve officer is promoted when the officer“s running mate is promoted and the promotion of the running mate is on a temporary basis, the promotion of the Reserve officer is also on a temporary basis. If subsequently the running mate is reverted to a lower grade, other than for reasons of discipline, incompetence, or at the running mate“s request, the Reserve officer shall likewise revert to the same lower grade with corresponding precedence.
