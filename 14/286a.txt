  (a) The severance pay of a regular warrant officer of the Coast Guard who is separated under section 580(a)(4)(A) of title 10 is computed by multiplying his years of active service that could be credited to him under section 511 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as amended, but not more than 12, by twice the monthly basic pay to which he is entitled at the time of separation.
  (b) The severance pay of a regular warrant officer of the Coast Guard who is separated under section 1166 of title 10 is computed by multiplying his years of active service that could be credited to him under section 511 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as amended, but not more than 12, by the monthly basic pay to which he is entitled at the time of separation, unless the Secretary determines that the conditions under which the officer is discharged or separated do not warrant payment of that amount of severance pay.
  (c) For the purposes of this section, a part of the year that is six months or more is counted as a whole year, and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded.
  (d) The acceptance of severance pay under this section does not deprive a person of any retirement benefits from the United States. However, there shall be deducted from each of his retirement payments so much thereof as is based on the service for which he has received severance pay under this section, until the total deductions equal the amount of such severance pay.
