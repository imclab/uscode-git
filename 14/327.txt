    (2) for discharge with separation benefits under section 286(c) of this title.
  (b) Each officer removed from active duty under section 326 of this title shall–
    (1) if on the date of removal the officer is eligible for voluntary retirement under any law, be retired in the grade for which he would be eligible if retired at his request; or
