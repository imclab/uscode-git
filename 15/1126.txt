    (2) Definitions
      (A) For purposes of paragraph (1), a mark is famous if it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark“s owner. In determining whether a mark possesses the requisite degree of recognition, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the following:
        (i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties.
        (ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.

        (iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.
      (B) For purposes of paragraph (1), ””dilution by blurring““ is association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.

        (i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
        (ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.

        (iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.
        (v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark.
        (vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
      (C) For purposes of paragraph (1), ””dilution by tarnishment““ is association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.

       The following shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under this subsection:
      (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or facilitation of such fair use, of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person“s own goods or services, including use in connection with–
        (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to compare goods or services; or
        (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.

      (A) the claimed trade dress, taken as a whole, is not functional and is famous; and
      (B) if the claimed trade dress includes any mark or marks registered on the principal register, the unregistered matter, taken as a whole, is famous separate and apart from any fame of such registered marks.
    (5) Additional remedies
       In an action brought under this subsection, the owner of the famous mark shall be entitled to injunctive relief as set forth in section 1116 of this title. The owner of the famous mark shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in sections 1117(a) and 1118 of this title, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity if–

       The ownership by a person of a valid registration under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register under this chapter shall be a complete bar to an action against that person, with respect to that mark, that–
