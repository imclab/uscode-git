  (a) Determination of entitlement
    (1) For purposes of determining the natural gas entitlement of any local distribution company under any curtailment plan, if the Commission revises any base period established under such plan, the volumes of natural gas which such local distribution company demonstrates–

      (B) were conserved by reason of the implementation of such conservation measures,
         shall be treated by the Commission following such revision as continuing to be used for the priority use referred to in subparagraph (A).
    (2) The Commission shall, by rule, prescribe methods for measurement of volumes of natural gas to which subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) apply.
  (b) Conditions, limitations, etc.
     Subsection (a) of this section shall not limit or otherwise affect any provision of any curtailment plan, or any other provision of law or regulation, under which natural gas may be diverted or allocated to respond to emergency situations or to protect public health, safety, and welfare.
