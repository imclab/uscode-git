  (a) Short title
     This section may be cited as the ””Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act““.
  (b) Safety standards
    (1) In general
       The Commission shall–
      (A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and
      (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, promulgate consumer product safety standards that–
        (i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or
        (ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.
    (2) Timetable for rulemaking
       Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.
    (3) Judicial review
       Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in section 2060(g) of this title, as added by section 236 of this Act.
    (4) Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard
      (A) Notice of adoption of voluntary standard
         When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission“s action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.
      (B) Commission action on revised voluntary standard
         If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title, effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.
  (c) Cribs
    (1) In general
       It shall be a violation of section 2068(a)(1) of this title for any person to which this subsection applies to manufacture, sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, offer, provide for use, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce a crib that is not in compliance with a standard promulgated under subsection (b).
    (2) Persons to which subsection applies
       This subsection applies to any person that–
      (A) manufactures, distributes in commerce, or contracts to sell cribs;
      (B) based on the person“s occupation, holds itself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to cribs, including child care facilities and family child care homes;
      (C) is in the business of contracting to sell or resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place cribs in the stream of commerce; or
      (D) owns or operates a place of public accommodation affecting commerce (as defined in section 2203 of this title applied without regard to the phrase ””not owned by the Federal Government““).
    (3) Application of any revision
       With respect to any revision of the standard promulgated under subsection (b)(1)(B) subsequent to the initial promulgation of a standard under such subsection, paragraph (1) shall apply only to a person that manufactures or imports cribs, unless the Commission determines that application to any other person described in paragraph (2) is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk to health or safety. If the Commission determines that application to a person described in paragraph (2) is necessary, it shall provide not less than 12 months for such person to come into compliance.
    (4) Crib defined
       In this subsection, the term ””crib““ includes–
      (A) new and used cribs;
      (B) full-sized or nonfull-sized cribs; and
      (C) portable cribs and crib-pens.
  (d) Consumer registration requirement
    (1) Rulemaking
       Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 6 of title 5 or the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall, pursuant to its authority under section 2065(b) of this title, promulgate a final consumer product safety rule to require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product–
      (A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;
      (B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and
      (C) to permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product.
    (2) Requirements for registration form
       The registration form required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (1) shall–
      (A) include spaces for a consumer to provide the consumer“s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
      (B) include space sufficiently large to permit easy, legible recording of all desired information;
      (C) be attached to the surface of each durable infant or toddler product so that, as a practical matter, the consumer must notice and handle the form after purchasing the product;
      (D) include the manufacturer“s name, model name and number for the product, and the date of manufacture;
      (E) include a message explaining the purpose of the registration and designed to encourage consumers to complete the registration;
      (F) include an option for consumers to register through the Internet; and
      (G) include a statement that information provided by the consumer shall not be used for any purpose other than to facilitate a recall of or safety alert regarding that product.

    (3) Record keeping and notification requirements
       The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.
    (4) Study
       The Commission shall conduct a study at such time as it considers appropriate on the effectiveness of the consumer registration forms required by this section in facilitating product recalls and whether such registration forms should be required for other children“s products. Not later than 4 years after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall report its findings to the appropriate Congressional committees.
  (e) Use of alternative recall notification technology
    (1) Technology assessment and report
       The Commission shall–
      (A) beginning 2 years after a rule is promulgated under subsection (d), regularly review recall notification technology and assess the effectiveness of such technology in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products; and
      (B) not later than 3 years after August 14, 2008, and periodically thereafter as the Commission considers appropriate, transmit a report on such assessments to the appropriate Congressional committees.
    (2) Determination
       If, based on the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission determines by rule that a recall notification technology is likely to be as effective or more effective in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products as the registration forms required by subsection (d), the Commission–
      (A) shall submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a report on such determination; and
      (B) shall permit a manufacturer of durable infant or toddler products to use such technology in lieu of such registration forms to facilitate recalls of durable infant or toddler products.
