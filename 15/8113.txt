    (1) Reducing counterfeit and infringing goods in the domestic and international supply chain.

    (4) Disrupting and eliminating domestic and international counterfeiting and infringement networks.
    (5) Strengthening the capacity of other countries to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, and reducing the number of countries that fail to enforce laws preventing the financing, production, trafficking, and sale of counterfeit and infringing goods.
    (6) Working with other countries to establish international standards and policies for the effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
    (7) Protecting intellectual property rights overseas by–
      (A) working with other countries and exchanging information with appropriate law enforcement agencies in other countries relating to individuals and entities involved in the financing, production, trafficking, or sale of counterfeit and infringing goods;
