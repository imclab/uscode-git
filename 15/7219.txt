The budget of the Board shall be subject to approval by the Commission.

    (2) Assessments
       The rules of the Board under paragraph (1) shall provide for the equitable allocation, assessment, and collection by the Board (or an agent appointed by the Board) of the fee established under paragraph (1), among issuers, in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, and among brokers and dealers, in accordance with subsection (h), and allowing for differentiation among classes of issuers, brokers and dealers, as appropriate.
    (3) Brokers and dealers
       The Board shall begin the allocation, assessment, and collection of fees under paragraph (2) with respect to brokers and dealers with the payment of support fees to fund the first full fiscal year beginning after July 21, 2010.

    (2) may differentiate among different classes of issuers.
  (f) Limitation on fee
     The amount of fees collected under this section for a fiscal year on behalf of the Board or the standards setting body, as the case may be, shall not exceed the recoverable budget expenses of the Board or body, respectively (which may include operating, capital, and accrued items), referred to in subsection (c)(1) of this section.
  (g) Allocation of accounting support fees among issuers
     Any amount due from issuers (or a particular class of issuers) under this section to fund the budget of the Board or the standard setting body referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be allocated among and payable by each issuer (or each issuer in a particular class, as applicable) in an amount equal to the total of such amount, multiplied by a fraction–
    (1) the numerator of which is the average monthly equity market capitalization of the issuer for the 12-month period immediately preceding the beginning of the fiscal year to which such budget relates; and
    (2) the denominator of which is the average monthly equity market capitalization of all such issuers for such 12-month period.
  (h) Allocation of accounting support fees among brokers and dealers
    (1) Obligation to pay
       Each broker or dealer shall pay to the Board the annual accounting support fee allocated to such broker or dealer under this section.
    (2) Allocation

    (3) Proportionality
       The amount due from a broker or dealer shall be in proportion to the net capital of the broker or dealer (before or after any adjustments), compared to the total net capital of all brokers and dealers (before or after any adjustments), in accordance with rules issued by the Board.
      (i) Omitted
      (j) Rule of construction
         Nothing in this section shall be construed to render either the Board, the standard setting body referred to in subsection (a) of this section, or both, subject to procedures in Congress to authorize or appropriate public funds, or to prevent such organization from utilizing additional sources of revenue for its activities, such as earnings from publication sales, provided that each additional source of revenue shall not jeopardize, in the judgment of the Commission, the actual and perceived independence of such organization.
      (k) Start-up expenses of the Board
         From the unexpended balances of the appropriations to the Commission for fiscal year 2003, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to advance to the Board not to exceed the amount necessary to cover the expenses of the Board during its first fiscal year (which may be a short fiscal year).
