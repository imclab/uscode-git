  (a) In general
     In connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by a consumer“s principal dwelling, no servicer shall fail to credit a payment to the consumer“s loan account as of the date of receipt, except when a delay in crediting does not result in any charge to the consumer or in the reporting of negative information to a consumer reporting agency, except as required in subsection (b).
  (b) Exception
     If a servicer specifies in writing requirements for the consumer to follow in making payments, but accepts a payment that does not conform to the requirements, the servicer shall credit the payment as of 5 days after receipt.
