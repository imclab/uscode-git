    (4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to section 636(a) of this title, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title or subsection (e) of this section.

In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.

    (5)      (A) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.
      (B) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.
    (6) If the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under section 636(a) of this title is more than $500,000, the Administrator shall, upon request of a pool assembler, divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000.

      (B) contract with an agent to carry out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions of this section and the issuance of trust certificates to facilitate pooling. Such agent shall provide a fidelity bond or insurance in such amounts as the Administration determines to be necessary to fully protect the interest of the Government;
      (C) prior to any sale, require the seller to disclose to a purchaser of the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to the purchaser of a trust certificate issued pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this paragraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term ””seller““ does not include (A) an entity which made the loan or (B) any individual or entity which sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year; and
      (D) have the authority to regulate brokers and dealers in guaranteed loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
