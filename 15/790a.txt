The System shall contain such information as is required to provide a description of and facilitate analysis of energy supply and consumption within and affecting the United States on the basis of such geographic areas and economic sectors as may be appropriate to meet adequately the needs of–
    (1) the Federal Energy Administration in carrying out its lawful functions;
    (2) the Congress;
    (3) other officers and employees of the United States in whom have been vested, or to whom have been delegated energy-related policy decisionmaking responsibilities; and

    (2) the consumption of mineral fuels, nonmineral energy resources, and electricity by such classes, sectors, and regions as may be appropriate for the purposes of this chapter;
    (3) the sensitivity of energy resource reserves, exploration, development, production, transportation, and consumption to economic factors, environmental constraints, technological improvements, and substitutability of alternate energy sources;
    (4) the comparability of energy information and statistics that are supplied by different sources;
    (5) industrial, labor, and regional impacts of changes in patterns of energy supply and consumption;
    (6) international aspects, economic and otherwise, of the evolving energy situation; and
    (7) long-term relationships between energy supply and consumption in the United States and world communities.
