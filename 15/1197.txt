  (a) Defense to prosecution
     No person shall be subject to prosecution under section 1196 of this title for a violation of section 1192 of this title if such person (1) establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, to the effect that reasonable and representative tests made in accordance with standards issued or amended under the provisions of section 1193 of this title show that the fabric or related material covered by the guaranty, or used in the product covered by the guaranty, conforms with applicable flammability standards issued or amended under the provisions of section 1193 of this title, and (2) has not, by further processing, affected the flammability of the fabric, related material, or product covered by the guaranty which he received. Such guaranty shall be either (1) a separate guaranty specifically designating the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed, in which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to such product, fabric, or related material; (2) a continuing guaranty given by seller to buyer applicable to any product, fabric, or related material sold or to be sold to buyer by seller in a form as the Commission by rules and regulations may prescribe; or (3) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission applicable to any product, fabric, or related material handled by a guarantor, in such form as the Commission by rules or regulations may prescribe.
  (b) False guaranty
     It shall be unlawful for any person to furnish, with respect to any product, fabric, or related material, a false guaranty (except a person relying upon a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received) with reason to believe the product, fabric, or related material falsely guaranteed may be introduced, sold, or transported in commerce, and any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of an unfair method of competition, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice, in commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.].
