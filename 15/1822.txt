   The Congress finds and declares thatâ€“
  (1) the soring of horses is cruel and inhumane;
  (2) horses shown or exhibited which are sore, where such soreness improves the performance of such horse, compete unfairly with horses which are not sore;
  (3) the movement, showing, exhibition, or sale of sore horses in intrastate commerce adversely affects and burdens interstate and foreign commerce;
  (4) all horses which are subject to regulation under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect such commerce; and
  (5) regulation under this chapter by the Secretary is appropriate to prevent and eliminate burdens upon commerce and to effectively regulate commerce.
