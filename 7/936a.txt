    (1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a) of this section, prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or Public Law 99–349 in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.
