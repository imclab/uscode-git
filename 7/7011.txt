  (a) Voluntary agreement
    (1) In general
       If the exercise of the Secretary“s authority under this chapter results in changes to an existing bargaining unit that has been certified under chapter 71 of title 5, the affected parties shall attempt to reach a voluntary agreement on a new bargaining unit and an exclusive representative for such unit.
    (2) Criteria
       In carrying out the requirements of this subsection, the affected parties shall use criteria set forth in–
      (A) sections 7103(a)(4), 7111(e), 7111(f)(1), and 7120 of title 5, relating to determining an exclusive representative; and
      (B) section 7112 of title 5 (disregarding subsections (b)(5) and (d) thereof), relating to determining appropriate units.
  (b) Effect of an agreement

       If the affected parties reach agreement on the appropriate unit and the exclusive representative for such unit under subsection (a) of this section, the Federal Labor Relations Authority shall certify the terms of such agreement, subject to paragraph (2)(A). Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to require the holding of any hearing or election as a condition for certification.
    (2) Restrictions
      (A) Conditions requiring noncertification
         The Federal Labor Relations Authority may not certify the terms of an agreement under paragraph (1) if–

        (ii) after the Secretary“s exercise of authority and before certification under this section, a valid election under section 7111(b) of title 5 is held covering any employees who would be included in the unit proposed for certification.
      (B) Temporary waiver of provision that would bar an election after a collective bargaining agreement is reached
         Nothing in section 7111(f)(3) of title 5 shall prevent the holding of an election under section 7111(b) of such title that covers employees within a unit certified under paragraph (1), or giving effect to the results of such an election (including a decision not to be represented by any labor organization), if the election is held before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date such unit is so certified.
      (C) Clarification
         The certification of a unit under paragraph (1) shall not, for purposes of the last sentence of section 7111(b) of title 5 or section 7111(f)(4) of such title, be treated as if it had occurred pursuant to an election.

      (B) Review
         Any action taken by a regional director under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to review under the provisions of section 7105(f) of title 5 in the same manner as if such action had been taken under section 7105(e) of such title, except that in the case of a decision not to certify, such review shall be required if application therefor is filed by an affected party within the time specified in such provisions.
  (c) ””Affected party““ defined
     For purposes of this section, the term ””affected party““ means–
