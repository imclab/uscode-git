        (iii) any child support payments not assigned to the State under the provisions of part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, less $50 per month, shall be considered part of the aggregate value of assistance participating families would receive if such families did not participate in the Project;

      (B) in the case of families determined ineligible for the Project upon application, the application for the Project shall be deemed an application for the food stamp program, and benefits under the food stamp program shall be issued to those found eligible following the standards established under the food stamp program;
      (C) expedited benefits shall be provided under terms no more restrictive than under paragraph (9) of section 2020(e) of this title and the laws of Minnesota and shall include expedited issuance of designated food assistance provided through the Project or expedited benefits through the food stamp program;

Food coupons shall be provided to families and individuals excluded from the Project under this clause who are determined eligible for the food stamp program retroactive to the date of the determination of eligibility.

      (C) Each family whose Project participation is terminated shall be screened for potential eligibility for the food stamp program and if the screening indicates potential eligibility, the family or family member shall be given a specific request to supply all additional information needed to determine such eligibility and assistance in completing a signed food stamp program application including provision of any relevant information obtained by the State for purpose of the Project. If the family or family member supplies such additional information within ten days after receiving the request, the State shall, within five days after the State receives such information, determine whether the family or family member is eligible for the food stamp program.
