   The powers and duties conferred by sections 3602 and 3603 of this title shall be exercised in the manner the President considers appropriate to protect the interest of United States consumers. If the President determines that there has been an unwarranted increase in the price of sugar due in whole or in part to the Agreement, or to market manipulation by two or more members of the International Sugar Organization, the President shall request the International Sugar Council or the Executive Committee to increase supplies of sugar available to world markets by suspending sugar export quotas or to take any other appropriate action, and, at the same time, shall report that determination to the Congress. If the International Sugar Council fails to take corrective action to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after such request, the President shall submit to the Congress such recommendations as he may consider appropriate to correct the situation. In the event that members of the International Sugar Organization involved in market manipulation which has resulted in price increases have failed to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after a request for remedy, the exercise of the authority set forth in section 3602 of this title shall be suspended until the President determines that effective market manipulation activities have ceased.
