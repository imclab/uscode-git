   The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations necessary to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. However, any regulation identifying a noxious weed under section 2803 of this title shall be promulgated only after publication of a notice of the proposed regulation and, when requested by any interested person, a public hearing on the proposal. Any such regulation shall be based upon the information received at any such hearing and other information available to the Secretary and a determination by the Secretary that the plant is within the definition of a noxious weed in section 2802(c) of this title and that its dissemination in the United States may reasonably be expected to have, to a serious degree, any effect specified in section 2802(c) of this title.
