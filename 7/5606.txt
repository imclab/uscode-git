   Not later than September 30 of each year, the Secretary shall evaluate whether the obligations undertaken by foreign countries under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture are being fully implemented. If the Secretary has reason to believe (based on the evaluation) that any foreign country, by not implementing the obligations of the country, may be significantly constraining an opportunity for United States agricultural exports, the Secretary shallâ€“
  (1) submit the evaluation to the United States Trade Representative; and
  (2) transmit a copy of the evaluation to the Committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on Ways and Means, of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the Committee on Finance, of the Senate.
