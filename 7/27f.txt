  (a) Hybrid instruments
     No hybrid instrument shall be void, voidable, or unenforceable, and no party to a hybrid instrument shall be entitled to rescind, or recover any payment made with respect to, a hybrid instrument under any provision of Federal or State law, based solely on the failure of the hybrid instrument to satisfy the predominance test set forth in section 27c(b) of this title or to comply with the terms or conditions of an exemption or exclusion from any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] or any regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
  (b) Preemption
     Sections 27 to 27f of this title shall supersede and preempt the application of any State or local law that prohibits or regulates gaming or the operation of bucket shops (other than antifraud provisions of general applicability) in the case of a hybrid instrument that is predominantly a banking product.
