  (a) Programs
     In furtherance of an action plan, the Secretary may use the Extension Service and other appropriate agencies of the Department of Agriculture to develop and conduct education programs that assist businesses, elected or appointed officials, and individuals in rural communities to deal with the effects of a transition from being economically disadvantaged to economic diversification. These programs may includeâ€“
    (1) community economic analysis and strategic planning;
    (2) methods for improving and retooling enterprises now dependent on national forest resources;
    (3) methods for expanding enterprises and creating new economic opportunities by emphasizing economic opportunities in other industries or services not dependent on national forest resources; and
    (4) assistance in the evaluation, counseling, and enhancement of vocational skills, training in basic and remedial literacy skills, assistance in job seeking skills, and training in starting or operating a business enterprise.
  (b) Existing educational and training programs
     Insofar as practicable, the Secretary shall use existing Federal, State, and private education resources in carrying out these programs.
