   Any authorized inspector, when properly identified, shall have authority (a) without a warrant, to stop any person or means of conveyance moving into the United States, and inspect any noxious weeds and any products and articles of any character whatsoever, carried thereby, and inspect such means of conveyance, to determine whether such person or means of conveyance is moving any noxious weed, product, article, or means of conveyance contrary to this chapter or any regulation under this chapter; (b) without a warrant, to stop any person or means of conveyance moving through the United States or interstate, and inspect any noxious weeds and any products and articles of any character whatsoever carried thereby, and inspect such means of conveyance, to determine whether such person or means of conveyance is moving any noxious weed, product, article, or means of conveyance contrary to this chapter or any regulation thereunder, if such inspector has probable cause to believe that such person or means of conveyance is moving any noxious weed regulated under this chapter; and (c) to enter, with a warrant, any premises in the United States, for purposes of any inspections or other actions necessary under this chapter. Any judge of the United States or of a court of record of any State, territory, or district, or a United States commissioner, may, within his respective jurisdiction, upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause to believe that there are on certain premises any products, articles, means of conveyance, or noxious weeds subject to this chapter, issue warrants for the entry of such premises for purposes of any inspection or other action necessary under this chapter, except as otherwise provided in section 2808 of this title. Such warrants may be executed by any authorized inspector or any United States marshal.
