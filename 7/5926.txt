  (a) Purpose
     The program (hereafter referred to in this section as the ””program““) established under this section is intended to encourage the development and utilization of an agricultural communications network to facilitate and to strengthen agricultural extension, resident education and research, and domestic and international marketing of United States agricultural commodities and products through a partnership between eligible institutions and the Department of Agriculture. The network will employ satellite and other telecommunications technology to disseminate and to share academic instruction, cooperative extension programming, agricultural research, and marketing information.
  (b) Objectives
     The objectives of the program established under this section are–
    (1) to make optimal use of available resources for agricultural extension, resident education, and research by sharing resources between participating institutions;
    (2) to improve the competitive position of United States agriculture in international markets by disseminating information to producers, processors, and researchers;
    (3) to train students for careers in agriculture and food industries;
    (4) to facilitate interaction among leading agricultural scientists;
    (5) to enhance the ability of United States agriculture to respond to environmental and food safety concerns; and
    (6) to identify new uses for farm commodities and to increase the demand for United States agricultural products in both domestic and foreign markets.
