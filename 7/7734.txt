    (1) In general
       Any person that violates this chapter, or that forges, counterfeits, or, without authority from the Secretary, uses, alters, defaces, or destroys any certificate, permit, or other document provided for in this chapter may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record, be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary that does not exceed the greater of–
      (A) $50,000 in the case of any individual (except that the civil penalty may not exceed $1,000 in the case of an initial violation of this chapter by an individual moving regulated articles not for monetary gain), $250,000 in the case of any other person for each violation, and $500,000 for all violations adjudicated in a single proceeding; or
      (B) twice the gross gain or gross loss for any violation, forgery, counterfeiting, unauthorized use, defacing, or destruction of a certificate, permit, or other document provided for in this chapter that results in the person deriving pecuniary gain or causing pecuniary loss to another.
    (2) Factors in determining civil penalty
       In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations and the Secretary may consider, with respect to the violator–
      (A) ability to pay;
      (B) effect on ability to continue to do business;
      (C) any history of prior violations;
      (D) the degree of culpability; and
      (E) any other factors the Secretary considers appropriate.
    (3) Settlement of civil penalties
       The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty that may be assessed under this subsection.
    (4) Finality of orders
       The order of the Secretary assessing a civil penalty shall be treated as a final order reviewable under chapter 158 of title 28.

  (d) Guidelines for civil penalties
     The Secretary shall coordinate with the Attorney General to establish guidelines to determine under what circumstances the Secretary may issue a civil penalty or suitable notice of warning in lieu of prosecution by the Attorney General of a violation of this chapter.
