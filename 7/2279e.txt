  (a) In general
     Any person that causes harm to, or interferes with, an animal used for the purposes of official inspections by the Department of Agriculture, may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record, be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of Agriculture not to exceed $10,000.
  (b) Factors in determining civil penalty
     In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the offense.
  (c) Settlement of civil penalties
     The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty that may be assessed under this section.
  (d) Finality of orders
    (1) In general
       The order of the Secretary assessing a civil penalty shall be treated as a final order reviewable under chapter 158 of title 28. The validity of the order of the Secretary may not be reviewed in an action to collect the civil penalty.
    (2) Interest
       Any civil penalty not paid in full when due under an order assessing the civil penalty shall thereafter accrue interest until paid at the rate of interest applicable to civil judgments of the courts of the United States.
