  (a) Assessments
     At least once every two years, to the extent practicable, the Commission shall assess whether the trade monitoring system of each contract market satisfies section 7a(b) of this title.
  (b) Deficiency orders
    (1) Causes
       The Commission may issue a proposed deficiency order in accordance with paragraph (2), or take such other administrative or enforcement action as the Commission determines is appropriate, if, based on its assessment or on other information, the Commission at any time has reason to believe that a contract market“s trade monitoring system implemented pursuant to section 7a(b) of this title does not satisfy one or more of the requirements of such section.
    (2) Contents
       A proposed deficiency order issued under this subsection shall specify–
      (A) the deficiencies the Commission has reason to believe exist in the trade monitoring system of the contract market and a statement of reasons supporting the Commission“s belief that those deficiencies exist;
      (B) the corrective action that the Commission believes that the contract market must take and an acceptable timetable for such corrective action; and
      (C) a date, not less than twenty days from the date of issuance of the proposed deficiency order, when such deficiency order will become final, subject to subsection (d) \1\N of this section.
    (3) Remedies
       On becoming final, the Commission deficiency order may–
      (A) require the contract market to–
        (i) institute appropriate improvements in its trade monitoring system necessary to correct the deficiencies noted therein;
        (ii) satisfy stated objective performance criteria to correct such deficiencies;
        (iii) upgrade or reconfigure existing systems for collecting or processing relevant data on trading and trader or broker activity, including, where appropriate, the commitment of additional resources; or
      (B) revoke any exemption of the contract market from the regulations prohibiting the privilege of dual trading under section 6j(a) of this title, if the deficiency noted in such deficiency order relates to–
        (i) the audit trail system the contract market is required to maintain under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of section 7a(b) of this title; or
        (ii) the prevention, detection, or disciplining of violations attributable to such trading at such contract market, subject to the standards, exceptions, and duration provisions of section 6j(a) of this title; or
      (C) take any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
    (4) Removal
       If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record prior to such deficiency order becoming final, that a named officer, director, committee member, or employee of such contract market has willfully–
      (A) violated this chapter, the rules or regulations of the Commission thereunder, or the rules of such contract market;
      (B) abused the authority of such person; or
      (C) without reasonable justification or excuse, failed to enforce compliance with any provision of the rules of such contract market by any member or person associated with a member thereof,
       the Commission may issue a deficiency order under this section to remove such officer, director, committee member, or employee.
    (5) Designation as contract market
       Notwithstanding section 8 of this title, during the period that a proposed or final deficiency order under this section is in effect, the Commission may refrain from approving any application for designation as a contract market made by the board of trade whose contract market is the subject of such deficiency order.
    (6) Delegation
       The Commission shall not delegate the authority to issue deficiency orders under this subsection.
  (c) Rescission, modification, or delay of deficiency orders
     Before any proposed deficiency order issued by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section may become final, the Commission shall–
    (1) provide the affected contract market with an opportunity for a hearing through submission of written data, views, or arguments and, under terms set by the Commission at the request of the contract market, through an oral presentation of views and comments to the Commission, in order to petition the Commission to rescind, modify, or delay such deficiency order; and
    (2) rule on such petition, not less than twenty days before the deficiency order takes effect, making findings, as appropriate, as to whether–
      (A) the deficiencies cited by the Commission have been corrected or are being corrected under an expeditious timetable acceptable to the Commission;
      (B) the trade monitoring system of the contract market is deficient as noted in the deficiency order; or
      (C) the timetable for corrective action by the contract market in the proposed deficiency order, and the particular corrective action proposed, is appropriate in light of the deficiencies noted and the purposes of this chapter.
  (d) Penalties
     Violation of a final deficiency order issued under subsection (c) of this section shall be considered a violation of an order of the Commission for purposes of–
    (1) establishing liability and assessing penalties against a contract market or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof under section 13a or 13a–1 of this title; or
    (2) initiating proceedings under section 7b or 8(a) of this title.
  (e) Judicial review
    (1) Persons
       Any person, other than a contract market, aggrieved by a deficiency order issued under subsection (b)(4) of this section, may obtain review of such deficiency order when issued by the Commission under the terms and conditions in section 8(b) of this title.
    (2) Contract markets
       Any contract market that has petitioned the Commission to rescind, modify, or delay any proposed deficiency order issued under subsection (b) of this section may obtain judicial review of any final such deficiency order only in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party seeking review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, under the standards applicable to rulemaking proceedings under section 553 of title 5.
