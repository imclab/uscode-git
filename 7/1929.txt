  (a) Revolving fund
     The fund established pursuant to section 11(a) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended, shall hereafter be called the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund and is hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the ””fund““. The fund shall remain available as a revolving fund for the discharge of the obligations of the Secretary under agreements insuring loans under this subchapter and loans and mortgages insured under prior authority.
  (b) Deposits of funds; investments; purchase of notes
     Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States.

     The Secretary is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this subchapter.

     Notes and security acquired by the Secretary in connection with loans insured under this subchapter and under prior authority shall become a part of the fund. Notes may be held in the fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold by the Secretary with or without agreements for insurance thereof at the balance due thereon, or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time. All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund.
  (e) Deposit in fund of portion of charge on outstanding principal obligations; availability of remainder of charge, and merger with appropriations, for administrative expenses
     The Secretary shall deposit in the fund all or a portion, not to exceed one-half of 1 per centum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, of any charge collected in connection with the insurance of loans; and any remainder of any such charge shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration, in proportion to such charges collected in connection with the insurance of loans by such agency, to be transferred annually and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses for such agency.
  (f) Utilization of fund
     The Secretary may utilize the fund–

In the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;
    (2) to pay to the holder of the notes any deferred or defaulted installment or, upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary“s request, the entire balance due on the loan;
    (3) to purchase notes in accordance with agreements previously entered into;
    (4) to pay for contract services, taxes, insurance, prior liens, expenses necessary to make fiscal adjustments in connection with the application and transmittal of collections and other expenses and advances authorized in connection with insured loans, including the difference between interest payable by borrowers and interest to which insured lenders or insured holders are entitled under agreements with the Secretary included in contracts of insurance;
    (5) to pay the Secretary“s costs of administration necessary to insure, make grants, service, and otherwise carry out the programs under this chapter not specifically covered by the Rural Development Insurance Fund of section 1929a of this title, including costs of the Secretary incidental to guaranteeing loans under this chapter, either directly from the Fund or by transfers from the Fund to, and merger with, any appropriations for administrative expenses.

Such assets and their proceeds, including loans made out of the fund pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, the last sentence of section 1926(a)(1), and the last sentence of section 1927 of this title.
    (2) From time to time, and at least at the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay from the fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts interest on the value as determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Comptroller General, of the Government“s equity transferred to the fund pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection plus the cumulative amount of appropriations made available after enactment of this provision as capital and for administration of the programs financed from the fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the fund during the year. The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of loans made or insured from the fund, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest.
