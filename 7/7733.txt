  (a) Authority to issue
     The Secretary shall have power to subpoena the attendance and testimony of any witness, and the production of all documentary evidence relating to the administration or enforcement of this chapter or any matter under investigation in connection with this chapter.
  (b) Location of production
     The attendance of any witness and production of documentary evidence relevant to the inquiry may be required from any place in the United States.
  (c) Enforcement of Subpoena
     In the case of disobedience to a subpoena by any person, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction in which the investigation is conducted, or where the person resides, is found, transacts business, is licensed to do business, or is incorporated, in requiring the attendance and testimony of any witness and the production of documentary evidence. In case of a refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, a court may order the person to appear before the Secretary and give evidence concerning the matter in question or to produce documentary evidence. Any failure to obey the courtâ€œs order may be punished by the court as a contempt of the court.
  (d) Compensation

  (e) Procedures
     The Secretary shall publish procedures for the issuance of subpoenas under this section. Such procedures shall include a requirement that subpoenas be reviewed for legal sufficiency and signed by the Secretary. If the authority to sign a subpoena is delegated to an agency other than the Office of Administrative Law Judges, the agency receiving the delegation shall seek review for legal sufficiency outside that agency.
