For the purpose of this section ””rural development loans““ shall be those provided for by sections 1926(a)(1) and 1932 of this title, except loans (other than for water systems and waste disposal facilities) of a type authorized by section 1926(a)(1) of this title prior to its amendment by the Rural Development Act of 1972.
  (b) Transfer of assets and liabilities
     The assets and liabilities of the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund referred to in section 1929(a) of this title applicable to loans for water systems and waste disposal facilities under section 1926(a)(1) of this title are hereby transferred to the Insurance Fund. Such assets (including the proceeds thereof) and liabilities and rural development loans guaranteed or insured pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
  (c) Credits in the Treasury; investments; notes, purchasing authority of the Secretary
     Moneys in the Insurance Fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Insurance Fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. The Secretary may purchase with money in the Insurance Fund any notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining money for the Insurance Fund.
  (d) Notes, issuing authority of the Secretary; use of funds; terms and conditions, form, denominations, maturities, and interest rate of notes; notes, purchasing authority of the Secretary of the Treasury; public debt transactions
     The Secretary is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for making loans, advances, and authorized expenditures out of the Insurance Fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the average maturities of rural development loans made, guaranteed, or insured under this chapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary hereunder. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.
  (e) Notes and security as part of Insurance Fund; collection and sale of notes and other obligations; deposit of net proceeds in Insurance Fund
     Notes and security acquired by the Secretary in connection with rural development loans made, guaranteed, or insured under this chapter or transferred by subsection (b) of this section shall become a part of the Insurance Fund. Notes and other obligations may be held in the Insurance Fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold by the Secretary with or without agreements for insurance thereof at the balance due thereon, or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time, including sale on a nonrecourse basis. The Secretary and any subsequent purchaser of such notes and other obligations sold by the Secretary on a nonrecourse basis shall be relieved of any responsibilities that might have been imposed had the borrower remained indebted to the Secretary. All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the Insurance Fund.
  (f) Deposit of loan service charges in Insurance Fund
     The Secretary shall deposit in the Insurance Fund any charges collected for loan services provided by the Secretary as well as charges assessed for losses and costs of administration in connection with making, guaranteeing, or insuring rural development loans under this chapter.
  (g) Use of Insurance Fund
     The Secretary may utilize the Insurance Fund–
    (1) to pay amounts to which the holder of insured notes is entitled on loans heretofore or hereafter insured accruing between the date of any payments by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the holder. In the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;
    (2) to pay to the holder of insured notes any deferred or defaulted installment, or upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary“s request, the entire balance due on the loan;

    (6) to pay the difference between interest payments by borrowers and interest to which holders of insured notes are entitled under contracts of insurance heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Secretary; and
    (7) to pay the Secretary“s costs of administration necessary to insure loans under the programs referred to in subsection (a) of this section, make grants under sections 1926(a) and 1932 of this title, service, and otherwise carry out such programs, including costs of the Secretary incidental to guaranteeing rural development loans under this chapter, either directly from the Insurance Fund or by transfers from the Fund to, and merger with, any appropriations for administrative expenses.
