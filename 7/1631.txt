  (a) Congressional findings
     Congress finds that–
    (1) certain State laws permit a secured lender to enforce liens against a purchaser of farm products even if the purchaser does not know that the sale of the products violates the lender“s security interest in the products, lacks any practical method for discovering the existence of the security interest, and has no reasonable means to ensure that the seller uses the sales proceeds to repay the lender;
    (2) these laws subject the purchaser of farm products to double payment for the products, once at the time of purchase, and again when the seller fails to repay the lender;
    (3) the exposure of purchasers of farm products to double payment inhibits free competition in the market for farm products; and
    (4) this exposure constitutes a burden on and an obstruction to interstate commerce in farm products.
  (b) Declaration of purpose
     The purpose of this section is to remove such burden on and obstruction to interstate commerce in farm products.
