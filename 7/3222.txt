Funds appropriated under this section shall be used for expenses of conducting agricultural research, printing, disseminating the results of such research, contributing to the retirement of employees subject to the provisions of section 331 of this title, administrative planning and direction, and purchase and rental of land and the construction, acquisition, alteration, or repair of buildings necessary for conducting agricultural research.

No more than 5 percent of the funds received by an institution in any fiscal year, under this section, may be carried forward to the succeeding fiscal year.
  (b) Allocation and distribution of appropriated funds
     Beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979, the funds appropriated in each fiscal year under this section shall be distributed as follows:
    (1) Three per centum shall be available to the Secretary for administration of this section. These administrative funds may be used for transportation of scientists who are not officers or employees of the United States to research meetings convened for the purpose of assessing research opportunities or research planning.
    (2) The remainder shall be allotted among the eligible institutions as follows:
      (A) Funds up to the total amount made available to all eligible institutions in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, under section 450i of this title, shall be allocated among the eligible institutions in the same proportion as funds made available under section 450i of this title, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, are allocated among the eligible institutions.
      (B) Of funds in excess of the amount allocated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, 20 per centum shall be allotted among eligible institutions in equal proportions; 40 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the rural population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total rural population of all the States in which eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated; and the balance shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the farm population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total farm population of all the States in which the eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated.
     In computing the distribution of funds allocated under this subparagraph, the allotments to Tuskegee Institute and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University shall be determined as if each institution were in a separate State.
  (c) Comprehensive program of agricultural research for each State
     The director of the State agricultural experiment station in each State where an eligible institution is located and the research director specified in subsection (d) of this section in each of the eligible institutions in such State shall jointly develop, by mutual agreement, a comprehensive program of agricultural research in such State, to be submitted for approval by the Secretary within one year after September 29, 1977.

  (e) Mailing of bulletins, reports, periodicals, reprints, articles, and other publications
     Bulletins, reports, periodicals, reprints or articles, and other publications necessary for the dissemination of results of the research and experiments funded under this section, including lists of publications available for distribution by the eligible institutions, shall be transmitted in the mails of the United States under penalty indicia: T3ProvidedK, That each publication shall bear such indicia as are prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be mailed under such regulations as the Postmaster General may from time to time prescribe. Such publications may be mailed from the principal place of business of each eligible institution or from an established subunit of such institution.
  (f) Administration; rules and regulations; cooperation by and between institutions
     The Secretary shall be responsible for the proper administration of this section, and is authorized and directed to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out its provisions. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to furnish such advice and assistance as will best promote the purposes of this section, including participation in coordination of research initiated under this section by the eligible institutions, from time to time to indicate such lines of inquiry as to the Secretary seem most important, and to encourage and assist in the establishment and maintenance of cooperation by and between the several eligible institutions, the State agricultural experiment stations, and between them and the Department of Agriculture.

    (3) If the Secretary withholds from any eligible institution any portion of the appropriations available for allotment, the facts and reasons therefor shall be reported to the President and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the Treasury until the close of the next Congress. If the next Congress does not direct such sum to be paid, it shall be carried to surplus.
    (4) The Secretary shall make an annual report to Congress during the first regular session of each year of the receipts and expenditures and work of the eligible institutions under the provisions of this section and also whether any portion of the appropriation available for allotment to any institution has been withheld and if so the reasons therefor.
  (h) Existing legal relationships not impaired or modified
