  (a) Purpose
     It is the purpose of this section to–
    (1) authorize and support environmental assessment research to the extent necessary to help address general concerns about environmental effects of biotechnology; and
    (2) authorize research to help regulators develop policies, as soon as practicable, concerning the introduction into the environment of such technology.
  (b) Grant program
     The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a grant program within the Cooperative State Research Service and the Agricultural Research Service to provide the necessary funding for environmental assessment research concerning the introduction of genetically engineered organisms into the environment.
  (c) Types of research
     Types of research for which grants may be made under this section shall include the following:
    (1) Research designed to develop methods to physically and biologically contain genetically engineered animals, plants, and microorganisms once they are introduced into the environment.
    (2) Research designed to develop methods to monitor the dispersal of genetically engineered animals, plants, and microorganisms.
    (3) Research designed to further existing knowledge with respect to the rates and methods of gene transfer that may occur between genetically engineered organisms and related wild and agricultural organisms.
    (4) Other areas of research designed to further the purposes of this section.
  (d) Eligibility requirements
     Grants under this section shall be–
    (1) made on the basis of the quality of the proposed research project; and
    (2) available to any public or private research or educational institution or organization.
  (e) Consultation
     In considering specific areas of research for funding under this section, the Secretary of Agriculture shall consult with the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Office of Agricultural Biotechnology, and the Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee.
  (f) Program coordination
     The Secretary of Agriculture shall coordinate research funded under this section with the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency in order to avoid duplication of research activities.
  (g) Authorization of appropriations
    (1) In general
       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out this section.
    (2) Withholdings from biotechnology outlays
       The Secretary of Agriculture shall withhold from outlays of the Department of Agriculture for research on biotechnology, as defined and determined by the Secretary, at least one percent of such amount for the purpose of making grants under this section for research on biotechnology risk assessment.
