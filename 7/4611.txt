   For the purpose of ascertaining whether issuance of an order is approved or favored by producers and importers, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum among those producers and importers not exempt under section 4606(e)(2) of this title who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production and importation of honey. No order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be effective unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of such an order is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds of the producers and importers voting in such referendum or by a majority of the producers and importers voting in such referendum if such majority produced and imported not less than two-thirds of the honey produced and imported during the representative period. The ballots and other information or reports which reveal, or tend to reveal, the vote of any producer or importer of honey shall be held strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed.
