   It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury promptly to notify the Secretary of Agriculture of the arrival of any nursery stock at port of entry. The person receiving such stock at port of entry shall, immediately upon entry and before such stock is delivered for shipment or removed from the port of entry, advise the Secretary of Agriculture or, at his direction, the proper State, Territorial, or District official of the State or Territory or the District to which such nursery stock is destined, or both, as the Secretary of Agriculture may elect, of the name and address of the consignee, the nature and quantity of the stock it is proposed to ship, and the country and locality where the same was grown. No person shall ship or offer for shipment from one State or Territory or District of the United States into any other State or Territory or District, any nursery stock imported into the United States without notifying the Secretary of Agriculture or, at his direction, the proper State, Territorial, or District official of the State or Territory or District to which such nursery stock is destined, or both, as the Secretary of Agriculture may elect, immediately upon the delivery of the said stock for shipment, of the name and address of the consignee, of the nature and quantity of stock it is proposed to ship, and the country and locality where the same was grown, unless and until such imported stock has been inspected by the proper official of a State, Territory, or District of the United States. This section does not apply to nursery stock that is imported or entered from a country or a region of a country that the Secretary of Agriculture designates, pursuant to procedures set forth in such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, as exempt from the requirements of this section.
