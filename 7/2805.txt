  (a) Emergency disposal of infested products and articles
     Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary may, whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any noxious weed, seize, quarantine, treat, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as he deems appropriate, any product or article of any character whatsoever, or means of conveyance, which is moving into or through the United States or interstate, in bond or otherwise, and which he has reason to believe is infested by any noxious weed or contains any such weed, or which has moved into the United States, or interstate, and which he has reason to believe was infested by or contained any noxious weed at the time of such movement; and any noxious weed, product, article, or means of conveyance which is moving into or through the United States, or interstate, or has moved into the United States, or interstate, in violation of this chapter or any regulation hereunder.
  (b) Orders requiring disposal by owner; enforcement
     Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary may order the owner of any product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed subject to disposal under subsection (a) of this section, or his agent, to treat, destroy, or make other disposal of such product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed, without cost to the Federal Government and in such manner as the Secretary deems appropriate. The Secretary may apply to the United States District Court, or to the United States Court of any territory or possession, for the judicial district in which such person resides or transacts business or in which the product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed is found, for enforcement of such order by injunction, mandatory or otherwise. Process in any such case may be served in any judicial district wherein the defendant resides or transacts business or may be found, and subpenas for witnesses who are required to attend a court in any judicial district in such a case may run to any other judicial district.
  (c) Destruction, export, or return as the least drastic action
     No product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to shipping point of origin, or ordered to be destroyed, exported, or so returned under this section, unless in the opinion of the Secretary there is no less drastic action which would be adequate to prevent the dissemination of noxious weeds into the United States or interstate.
  (d) Actions against United States by owners; limitations; just compensation for unlawful disposal
     The owner of any product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, by the Secretary under this section, may bring an action against the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, within one year after such destruction or disposal, and recover just compensation for such destruction or disposal of such product, article, means of conveyance, or noxious weed (not including compensation for loss due to delays incident to determining its eligibility for movement under this chapter) if the owner establishes that such destruction or disposal was not authorized under this chapter. Any judgment rendered in favor of such owner shall be paid out of the money in the Treasury appropriated for administration of this chapter.
