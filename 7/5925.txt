       The Secretary shall make competitive grants, for periods not to exceed 5 years, to a State agricultural experiment station, a college or university, or a consortium of such entities, for a research project in the research areas identified in paragraph (3).
    (3) Research areas
       A grant available under paragraph (2) shall be awarded to an applicant to conduct research in–
      (A) the development of techniques to produce, from small-diameter, short-length, or otherwise irregular mesquite logs, solid-wood products useful as flooring, furniture parts, turning blanks, and such other uses as may have potential economic value;
      (B) the development of management techniques designed to improve stands for quality lumber production from mesquite; and
      (C) such other methods of production, harvesting, processing, and marketing that are designed to provide viable markets for mesquite and lead to the commercialization of mesquite as a cash crop.
    (4) Authorization of appropriations

    (2) Competitive grants
       The Secretary shall make competitive grants, for periods not to exceed 5 years, to a State agricultural experiment station, a college or university, or a consortium of such entities, for research projects in the research areas identified in paragraph (3).
    (3) Research areas
       A grant available under paragraph (2) shall be awarded to an applicant to conduct research–
      (A) to investigate, through genetic selection, the development of varieties of prickly pear with improved growth, freeze tolerance, and harvest characteristics;
      (B) to develop techniques to produce and process prickly pear as a food source; and
      (C) to continue to investigate the nutritional value and health benefits of prickly pears.
    (4) Authorization of appropriations
