   As soon as practicable before the Government of the United States enters into any bilateral international agreement, other than a treaty, involving a commitment on the part of the United States to assure access by a foreign country or instrumentality thereof to United States agricultural commodities or products thereof on a commercial basis, the President is encouraged to notify and consult with the appropriate committees of Congress for the purpose of setting forth in detail the terms of and reasons for negotiating such agreement.
