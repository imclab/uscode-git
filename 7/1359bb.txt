  (a) Sugar estimates
    (1) In general
       Not later than August 1 before the beginning of each of the 2008 through 2012 crop years for sugarcane and sugar beets, the Secretary shall estimate–
      (A) the quantity of sugar that will be subject to human consumption in the United States during the crop year;
      (B) the quantity of sugar that would provide for reasonable carryover stocks;
      (C) the quantity of sugar that will be available from carry-in stocks for human consumption in the United States during the crop year;
      (D) the quantity of sugar that will be available from the domestic processing of sugarcane, sugar beets, and in-process beet sugar; and
      (E) the quantity of sugars, syrups, and molasses that will be imported for human consumption or to be used for the extraction of sugar for human consumption in the United States during the crop year, whether the articles are under a tariff-rate quota or are in excess or outside of a tariff-rate quota.
    (2) Exclusion
       The estimates under this subsection shall not apply to sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to any sugar refined and reexported in refined form or in products containing sugar.
    (3) Reestimates
       The Secretary shall make reestimates of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports for a crop year as necessary, but not later than the beginning of each of the second through fourth quarters of the crop year.
  (b) Sugar allotments
    (1) Establishment
       By the beginning of each crop year, the Secretary shall establish for that crop year appropriate allotments under section 1359cc of this title for the marketing by processors of sugar processed from sugar cane or sugar beets or in-process beet sugar (whether the sugar beets or in-process beet sugar was produced domestically or imported) at a level that is–
      (A) sufficient to maintain raw and refined sugar prices above forfeiture levels so that there will be no forfeitures of sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation under the loan program for sugar established under section 7272 of this title; but
      (B) not less than 85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop year.
    (2) Products
       The Secretary may include sugar products, the majority content of which is sucrose for human consumption, derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, molasses, or sugar in the allotments established under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines it to be appropriate for purposes of this subpart.
  (c) Coverage of allotments
    (1) In general
       The marketing allotments under this subpart shall apply to the marketing by processors of sugar intended for domestic human consumption that has been processed from sugar cane, sugar beets, or in-process beet sugar, whether such sugar beets or in-process beet sugar was produced domestically or imported.
    (2) Exceptions
       Consistent with the administration of marketing allotments for each of the 2002 through 2007 crop years, the marketing allotments shall not apply to sugar sold–
      (A) to facilitate the exportation of the sugar to a foreign country, except that the exports of sugar shall not be eligible to receive credits under reexport programs for refined sugar or sugar containing products administered by the Secretary;
      (B) to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for that processor; or
      (C) for uses other than domestic human consumption, except for the sale of sugar for the production of ethanol or other bioenergy if the disposition of the sugar is administered by the Secretary under section 8110 of this title.
    (3) Requirement
       The sale of sugar described in paragraph (2)(B) shall be–
      (A) made prior to May 1; and
      (B) reported to the Secretary.
  (d) Prohibitions
    (1) In general
       During all or part of any crop year for which marketing allotments have been established, no processor of sugar beets or sugarcane shall market for domestic human consumption a quantity of sugar in excess of the allocation established for the processor, except–
      (A) to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for that other processor; or
      (B) to facilitate the exportation of the sugar.
    (2) Civil penalty
       Any processor who knowingly violates paragraph (1) shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission of the violation, of that quantity of sugar involved in the violation.
