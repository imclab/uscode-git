    (B) Prior to the suspension or modification of the registration of a person under this paragraph, the person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing at which the Commission shall have the burden of showing that the continued registration of the person does, or is likely to, pose a threat to the public interest or threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.
    (C) Any notice of suspension or modification issued under this paragraph shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is disposed of or until terminated by the Commission.
    (D) On disposition of such information, indictment, or complaint, the Commission may issue and serve on such person an order pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) to suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration of such person.
    (E) A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Commission from thereafter instituting any other proceedings under this chapter.
    (F) A person aggrieved by an order issued under this paragraph may obtain review of such order in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 8(b) of this title.
