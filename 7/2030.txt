  (b) Nature of Project
     In an application submitted under subsection (a) of this section, the State shall provide the following:
    (1) Except as provided in this section, the provisions of chapter 434 of the 1987 Washington Laws, as enacted in May 1987, shall apply to the operation of the Project.

      (C)        (i) The State may provide a standard benefit for food assistance under the Project, except that individuals who participate in the Project shall receive as food assistance for a month an amount of cash that is not less than the value of the assistance such individuals would otherwise receive under the food stamp program.
        (ii) The State may provide a cash benefit for food assistance equal to the value of the thrifty food plan.
      (D) Each month participants in the Project shall be notified by the State of the amount of Project assistance that is provided as food assistance for such month.

    (5) An assurance that the State will continue to carry out the food stamp program while the State carries out the Project.

  (d) Project application
    (1) Unless and until an application to participate in the Project is approved, and food assistance under the Project is made available to the applicant–
      (A) such application shall also be treated as an application to participate in the food stamp program; and
      (B) section 2020(e)(9) of this title shall apply with respect to such application.
    (2) Coupons provided under the food stamp program with respect to an individual who–
      (A) is participating in such program; and
