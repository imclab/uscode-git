Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize the withholding of information, including such procedures and guidelines, from the Congress.
    (4) Competitive disadvantage
       The Secretary shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic and foreign purchasers and users of agricultural commodities in any case in which the importation of a manufactured product made, in whole or in part, from a commodity made available for export under this section would place domestic users of the commodity at a competitive disadvantage.
    (5) Different commodities
       The Commodity Credit Corporation may provide to an exporter, user, or processor, or foreign purchaser, under the program established under this section, agricultural commodities of a kind different than the agricultural commodity involved in the transaction for which assistance under this section is being provided.
