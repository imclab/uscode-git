    (2) Program
       A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the food stamp program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.
    (3) Procedure
       If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the food stamp program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program–

      (A) System
         In carrying out the food stamp program, the Secretary shall carry out a system that enhances payment accuracy and improves administration by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high payment error rates to share in the cost of payment error.

        (i) In general
           Subject to clause (ii), with respect to any fiscal year before fiscal year 2003, the Secretary shall adjust a State agency“s federally funded share of administrative costs under subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing that share of all such administrative costs by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full \1/10\ of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent.
        (ii) Limitation
           Only States with a rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility that is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment under clause (i).

         With respect to fiscal year 2004 and any fiscal year thereafter for which the Secretary determines that, for the second or subsequent consecutive fiscal year, a 95 percent statistical probability exists that the payment error rate of a State agency exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish an amount for which the State agency may be liable (referred to in this paragraph as the ””liability amount““) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying–
        (i) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year;
        (ii) the difference between–
          (I) the payment error rate of the State agency; and

          (III) designate a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the amount established for the fiscal year for payment to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (E) (referred to in this paragraph as the ””at-risk amount““); or
          (IV) take any combination of the actions described in subclauses (I) through (III); or
        (ii) make the determinations described in clause (i) and enter into a settlement with the State agency, only with respect to any waiver amount or new investment amount, before the end of the fiscal year in which the liability amount is determined under subparagraph (C).
      (E) Payment of at-risk amount for certain States
        (i) In general
           A State agency shall pay to the Secretary the at-risk amount designated under subparagraph (D)(i)(III) for any fiscal year in accordance with clause (ii), if, with respect to the immediately following fiscal year, a liability amount has been established for the State agency under subparagraph (C).
        (ii) Method of payment of at-risk amount
          (I) Remission to the Secretary

           In the case of a State agency that fails to comply with a requirement for new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II) or clause (iii)(I), the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the portion of the liability amount that has not been used in accordance with that requirement.
        (ii) Effect of State agency“s wholly prevailing on appeal
           If a State agency begins required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is reduced to $0 on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was included in the liability amount subject to the appeal.
        (iii) Effect of Secretary“s wholly prevailing on appeal
           If a State agency does not begin required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is wholly upheld on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall–
          (I) require all or any portion of the new investment amount to be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the food stamp program, which amount shall not be matched by Federal funds; and
          (II) require payment of any remaining portion of the new investment amount in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii).
        (iv) Effect of neither party“s wholly prevailing on appeal
