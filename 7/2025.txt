       In this subsection, the term ””work supplementation or support program““ means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the food stamp program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.
    (2) Program
       A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the food stamp program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.
    (3) Procedure
       If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the food stamp program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program–
      (A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;
      (B) the State agency shall expend the amount received under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the work supplementation or support program in lieu of providing the allotment that the household would receive but for the operation of this subsection;

  (c) Payment error improvement system; purposes, establishment, definitions, implementation, etc.
    (1) The program authorized under this chapter shall include a system that enhances payment accuracy by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high error rates to share in the cost of payment error and provide enhanced administrative funding to States with the lowest error rates. Under such system–
      (A) the Secretary shall adjust a State agency“s federally funded share of administrative costs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing such share of all such administrative costs by one percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full one-tenth of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent, except that only States whose rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment prescribed in this subsection;
      (B) the Secretary shall foster management improvements by the States by requiring State agencies other than those receiving adjustments under subparagraph (A) to develop and implement corrective action plans to reduce payment errors; and
      (C) for any fiscal year in which a State agency“s payment error rate exceeds the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), other than for good cause shown, the State agency shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to–
        (i) \1\N the product of–
          (I) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year; times
          (II) the lesser of–
            (aa) the ratio of–
              (aaa) the amount by which the payment error rate of the State agency for the fiscal year exceeds the national performance measure for the fiscal year; to
              (bbb) the national performance measure for the fiscal year, or
            (bb) 1; times
          (III) the amount by which the payment error rate of the State agency for the fiscal year exceeds the national performance measure for the fiscal year.
       The amount of liability shall not be affected by corrective action under subparagraph (B).
    (2) As used in this section–
      (A) the term ””payment error rate““ means the sum of the point estimates of an overpayment error rate and an underpayment error rate determined by the Secretary from data collected in a probability sample of participating households;
      (B) the term ””overpayment error rate““ means the percentage of the value of all allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency that are either–
        (i) issued to households that fail to meet basic program eligibility requirements; or
        (ii) overissued to eligible households; and
      (C) the term ””underpayment error rate““ means the ratio of the value of allotments underissued to recipient households to the total value of allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency.
    (3) The following errors may be measured for management purposes but shall not be included in the payment error rate:
      (A) Any errors resulting in the application of new regulations promulgated under this chapter during the first 120 days from the required implementation date for such regulations.

    (4) The Secretary may require a State agency to report any factors that the Secretary considers necessary to determine a State agency“s payment error rate, enhanced administrative funding, or claim for payment error, under this subsection. If a State agency fails to meet the reporting requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall base the determination on all pertinent information available to the Secretary.
    (5) To facilitate the implementation of this subsection each State agency shall submit to the Secretary expeditiously data regarding its operations in each fiscal year sufficient for the Secretary to establish the payment error rate for the State agency for such fiscal year and determine the amount of either incentive payments under paragraph (1)(A) or claims under paragraph (1)(C). The Secretary shall make a determination for a fiscal year, and notify the State agency of such determination, within nine months following the end of each fiscal year. The Secretary shall initiate efforts to collect the amount owed by the State agency as a claim established under paragraph (1)(C) for a fiscal year, subject to the conclusion of any formal or informal appeal procedure and administrative or judicial review under section 2023 of this title (as provided for in paragraph (7)), before the end of the fiscal year following such fiscal year.
    (6) At the time the Secretary makes the notification to State agencies of their error rates and incentive payments or claims pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(C), the Secretary shall also announce a national performance measure that shall be the sum of the products of each State agency“s error rate as developed for the notifications under paragraph (5) times that State agency“s proportion of the total value of national allotments issued for the fiscal year using the most recent issuance data available at the time of the notifications issued pursuant to paragraph (5). Where a State fails to meet reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (4), the Secretary may use another measure of a State“s error developed pursuant to paragraph (5), to develop the national performance measure. The announced national performance measure shall be used in determining the State share of the cost of payment error under paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year whose error rates are being announced under paragraph (5).
    (7) If the Secretary asserts a financial claim against a State agency under paragraph (1)(C), the State may seek administrative and judicial review of the action pursuant to section 2023 of this title.
    (8)      (A) This paragraph applies to the determination of whether a payment is due by a State agency for a fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C).

        (i) not later than 60 days after receipt of rebuttal evidence submitted by the State agency; or
        (ii) if the State agency does not submit rebuttal evidence, not later than 90 days after the State agency submits the notice of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal.
      (H) In considering a claim under this paragraph, the administrative law judge shall consider all grounds for denying the claim, in whole or in part, including the contention of a State agency that the claim should be waived, in whole or in part, for good cause.
        (I) The deadlines in subparagraphs (D), (E), (F), and (G) shall be extended by the administrative law judge for cause shown.

      (E) a significant circumstance beyond the control of the State agency.
  (d) Assessment and evaluation of payment error improvement system
     The Secretary shall undertake the following studies of the payment error improvement system established under subsection (c) of this section:
