The officials responsible for making determinations of ineligibility under this chapter shall not receive or benefit from revenues retained by the State under the provisions of this subsection.
  (b) Work supplementation or support program
    (1) ””Work supplementation or support program““ defined
       In this subsection, the term ””work supplementation or support program““ means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the food stamp program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.
    (2) Program
       A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the food stamp program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.
    (3) Procedure
       If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the food stamp program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program–
      (A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;
      (B) the State agency shall expend the amount received under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the work supplementation or support program in lieu of providing the allotment that the household would receive but for the operation of this subsection;
      (C) for purposes of–
        (i) sections 2014 and 2017(a) of this title, the amount received under this subsection shall be excluded from household income and resources; and

    (4) Other work requirements
       No individual shall be excused, by reason of the fact that a State has a work supplementation or support program, from any work requirement under section 2015(d) of this title, except during the periods in which the individual is employed under the work supplementation or support program.
    (5) Length of participation
       A State agency shall provide a description of how the public assistance recipients in the program shall, within a specific period of time, be moved from supplemented or supported employment to employment that is not supplemented or supported.
    (6) Displacement
       A work supplementation or support program shall not displace the employment of individuals who are not supplemented or supported.
  (c) Payment error improvement system; purposes, establishment, definitions, implementation, etc.
    (1) The program authorized under this chapter shall include a system that enhances payment accuracy by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high error rates to share in the cost of payment error and provide enhanced administrative funding to States with the lowest error rates. Under such system–
      (A) the Secretary shall adjust a State agency“s federally funded share of administrative costs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing such share of all such administrative costs by one percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full one-tenth of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent, except that only States whose rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment prescribed in this subsection;
      (B) the Secretary shall foster management improvements by the States by requiring State agencies other than those receiving adjustments under subparagraph (A) to develop and implement corrective action plans to reduce payment errors; and
      (C) for any fiscal year in which a State agency“s payment error rate exceeds the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), other than for good cause shown, the State agency shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to–
        (i) \1\N the product of–
          (I) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year; times
          (II) the lesser of–
            (aa) the ratio of–
              (aaa) the amount by which the payment error rate of the State agency for the fiscal year exceeds the national performance measure for the fiscal year; to
              (bbb) the national performance measure for the fiscal year, or
            (bb) 1; times
          (III) the amount by which the payment error rate of the State agency for the fiscal year exceeds the national performance measure for the fiscal year.
       The amount of liability shall not be affected by corrective action under subparagraph (B).
    (2) As used in this section–
      (A) the term ””payment error rate““ means the sum of the point estimates of an overpayment error rate and an underpayment error rate determined by the Secretary from data collected in a probability sample of participating households;
      (B) the term ””overpayment error rate““ means the percentage of the value of all allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency that are either–
        (i) issued to households that fail to meet basic program eligibility requirements; or
        (ii) overissued to eligible households; and
      (C) the term ””underpayment error rate““ means the ratio of the value of allotments underissued to recipient households to the total value of allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency.
    (3) The following errors may be measured for management purposes but shall not be included in the payment error rate:
      (A) Any errors resulting in the application of new regulations promulgated under this chapter during the first 120 days from the required implementation date for such regulations.
      (B) Errors resulting from the use by a State agency of correctly processed information concerning households or individuals received from Federal agencies or from actions based on policy information approved or disseminated, in writing, by the Secretary or the Secretary“s designee.
    (4) The Secretary may require a State agency to report any factors that the Secretary considers necessary to determine a State agency“s payment error rate, enhanced administrative funding, or claim for payment error, under this subsection. If a State agency fails to meet the reporting requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall base the determination on all pertinent information available to the Secretary.
    (5) To facilitate the implementation of this subsection each State agency shall submit to the Secretary expeditiously data regarding its operations in each fiscal year sufficient for the Secretary to establish the payment error rate for the State agency for such fiscal year and determine the amount of either incentive payments under paragraph (1)(A) or claims under paragraph (1)(C). The Secretary shall make a determination for a fiscal year, and notify the State agency of such determination, within nine months following the end of each fiscal year. The Secretary shall initiate efforts to collect the amount owed by the State agency as a claim established under paragraph (1)(C) for a fiscal year, subject to the conclusion of any formal or informal appeal procedure and administrative or judicial review under section 2023 of this title (as provided for in paragraph (7)), before the end of the fiscal year following such fiscal year.
    (6) At the time the Secretary makes the notification to State agencies of their error rates and incentive payments or claims pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(C), the Secretary shall also announce a national performance measure that shall be the sum of the products of each State agency“s error rate as developed for the notifications under paragraph (5) times that State agency“s proportion of the total value of national allotments issued for the fiscal year using the most recent issuance data available at the time of the notifications issued pursuant to paragraph (5). Where a State fails to meet reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (4), the Secretary may use another measure of a State“s error developed pursuant to paragraph (5), to develop the national performance measure. The announced national performance measure shall be used in determining the State share of the cost of payment error under paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year whose error rates are being announced under paragraph (5).
    (7) If the Secretary asserts a financial claim against a State agency under paragraph (1)(C), the State may seek administrative and judicial review of the action pursuant to section 2023 of this title.
    (8)      (A) This paragraph applies to the determination of whether a payment is due by a State agency for a fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C).

        (ii) evidence in support of the appeal of the State agency, not later than 60 days after receiving a notice of the claim.
      (E) Not later than 60 days after a State agency submits evidence in support of the appeal, the Secretary shall submit responsive evidence to the administrative law judge to the extent such evidence exists.
      (F) Not later than 30 days after the Secretary submits responsive evidence, the State agency shall submit rebuttal evidence to the administrative law judge to the extent such evidence exists.
      (G) The administrative law judge, after an evidentiary hearing, shall decide the appeal–
        (i) not later than 60 days after receipt of rebuttal evidence submitted by the State agency; or
        (ii) if the State agency does not submit rebuttal evidence, not later than 90 days after the State agency submits the notice of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal.
      (H) In considering a claim under this paragraph, the administrative law judge shall consider all grounds for denying the claim, in whole or in part, including the contention of a State agency that the claim should be waived, in whole or in part, for good cause.
        (I) The deadlines in subparagraphs (D), (E), (F), and (G) shall be extended by the administrative law judge for cause shown.

      (B) a strike by employees of a State agency who are necessary for the determination of eligibility and processing of case changes under the food stamp program;
      (C) a significant growth in food stamp caseload in a State prior to or during a fiscal year, such as a 15 percent growth in caseload;
      (D) a change in the food stamp program or other Federal or State program that has a substantial adverse impact on the management of the food stamp program of a State; and
      (E) a significant circumstance beyond the control of the State agency.
  (d) Assessment and evaluation of payment error improvement system
     The Secretary shall undertake the following studies of the payment error improvement system established under subsection (c) of this section:
