    (5)      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the interest rate on any loan made under this subchapter as a guaranteed loan shall be such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender, but not in excess of a rate as may be determined by the Secretary.

Wherever practicable, construction by a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of local government that is supported by loans described in the preceding sentence shall be placed on land that is not prime farmland, in order to preserve the maximum practicable amount of prime farmlands for production of food and fiber. Where other options exist for the siting of such construction and where the governmental authority still desires to carry out such construction on prime farmland, the 2 per centum interest rate increase provided by this clause shall apply, but such increased interest rate shall not apply where such other options do not exist.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ””prime farmland““ means prime farmlands and unique farmland as those terms are defined in sections 657.5(a) and (b) of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (1980).
  (b) Payment of charges; prepayment of taxes and insurance
     The borrower shall pay such fees and other charges as the Secretary may require, and borrowers under this chapter shall prepay to the Secretary such taxes and insurance as the Secretary may require, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
  (c) Mortgages, liens, and other security
     The Secretary shall take as security for the obligations entered into in connection with loans, mortgages on farms with respect to which such loans are made or such other security as the Secretary may require, and for obligations in connection with loans to associations under section 1926 of this title, shall take liens on the facility or such other security as he may determine to be necessary. Such security instruments may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that the notes may be held by lenders other than the United States. A borrower may use the same collateral to secure two or more loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this subchapter, except that the outstanding amount of such loans may not exceed the total value of the collateral so used.
  (d) Mineral rights as collateral
     With respect to a farm ownership loan made after December 23, 1985, unless appraised values of the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals are specifically included as part of the appraised value of collateral securing the loan, the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals located under the property shall not be considered part of the collateral securing the loan. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the inclusion of, as part of the collateral securing the loan, any payment or other compensation the borrower may receive for damages to the surface of the collateral real estate resulting from the exploration for or recovery of minerals.
  (e) Additional collateral
     The Secretary may not–
    (1) require any borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a farmer program loan made or insured under this chapter, if the borrower is current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan; or
    (2) bring any action to foreclose, or otherwise liquidate, any such loan as a result of the failure of a borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a loan, if the borrower was current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan at the time the additional collateral was requested.
