   Every warehouseman conducting a warehouse licensed under this chapter shall keep the agricultural products therein of one depositor so far separate from agricultural products of other depositors, and from other agricultural products of the same depositor for which a separate receipt has been issued, as to permit at all times the identification and redelivery of the agricultural products deposited; but if authorized by agreement or by custom, a warehouseman may mingle fungible agricultural products with other agricultural products of the same kind and grade, and shall be severally liable to each depositor for the care and redelivery of his share of such mass, to the same extent and under the same circumstances as if the agricultural products had been kept separate, but he shall at no time while they are in his custody mix fungible agricultural products of different grades.
