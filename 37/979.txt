  (a) No part of the income or assets of the corporation shall inure to any of its members, governors, or officers as such, or be distributable to any of them during the life of the corporation or upon its dissolution or final liquidation. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of compensation to officers and employees of the corporation in amounts approved by the board of governors of the corporation.
  (b) The corporation shall not make loans to its members, governors, officers, or employees. Any governor who votes for or assents to the making of a loan or advance to a member, officer, governor or employee of the corporation, and any officer who participates in the making of such a loan or advance, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the amount of such loan until the repayment thereof.
